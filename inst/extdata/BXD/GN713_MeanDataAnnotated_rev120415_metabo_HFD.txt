51.02407804_MZ	Methanol	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Methanol is the simplest alcohol, and is a light, volatile, colourless, flammable, poisonous liquid with a distinctive odor that is somewhat milder and sweeter than ethanol (Wikipedia). Methanol is responsible for accidental, suicidal, and epidemic poisonings, resulting in death or permanent sequelae. Toxicity is due to the metabolic products of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase. (PMID 15627163). The rapid and accurate diagnosis of toxic alcohol poisoning due to methanol (methyl alcohol) is paramount in preventing serious adverse outcomes. The quantitative measurement of specific serum levels of methanol using gas chromatography is expensive, time consuming and generally only available at major tertiary-care facilities.

52.02081441_MZ	Hydroxylamine	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Hydroxylamine is a reactive chemical with formula NH2OH. It can be considered a hybrid of ammonia and water due to parallels it shares with each. At room temperature pure NH2OH is ordinarily a white, unstable crystalline, hygroscopic compound; however it is almost always encountered as an aqueous solution. A colorless inorganic compound (HONH2) used in organic synthesis and as a reducing agent, due to its ability to donate nitric oxide. Hydroxylamine may explode on heating. It is an irritant to the respiratory tract, skin, eyes, and other mucous membranes. It may be absorbed through the skin, is harmful if swallowed, and is a possible mutagen. NH2OH is an intermediate in the biological nitrification. The oxidation of NH3 is mediated by HAO (hydroxylamine oxidoreductase).

54.97564605_MZ	Hydrochloric acid	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Hydrochloric acid constitutes the majority of gastric acid, the human digestive fluid. In a complex process and at a large energetic burden, it is secreted by parietal cells (also known as oxyntic cells). These cells contain an extensive secretory network (called canaliculi) from which the HCl is secreted into the lumen of the stomach. They are part of the epithelial fundic glands (also known as oxyntic glands) in the stomach. The chemical compound hydrochloric acid is the aqueous (water-based) solution of hydrogen chloride gas (HCl). It is a strong acid, the major component of gastric acid and of wide industrial use. Hydrochloric acid must be handled with appropriate safety precautions because it is a highly corrosive liquid. Hydrochloric acid, or muriatic acid by its historical but still occasionally used name, has been an important and frequently used chemical from early history and was discovered by the alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan around the year 800. Hydrogen chloride, also known under the name HCl, is a highly corrosive and toxic colorless gas that forms white fumes on contact with humidity. These fumes consist of hydrochloric acid which forms when hydrogen chloride dissolves in water. The hydrogen chloride molecule HCl is a simple diatomic molecule consisting of a hydrogen atom H and a chlorine atom Cl connected with a covalent single bond. Since the chlorine atom is much more electronegative than the hydrogen atom, the covalent bond between the atoms is quite polar. Hydrogen chloride forms corrosive hydrochloric acid on contact with body tissue. Inhalation of the fumes can cause coughing, choking, inflammation of the nose, throat, and upper respiratory tract, and in severe cases, pulmonary edema, circulatory system failure, and death. Skin contact can cause redness, pain, and severe skin burns. Hydrogen chloride may cause severe burns to the eye and permanent eye damage.

57.03446253_MZ	Acetone	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Acetone is one of the ketone bodies produced during ketoacidosis. Acetone is not regarded as a waste product of metabolism. However, its physiological role in biochemical machinery is not clear. A model for the role of acetone metabolism is presented that orders the events occurring in acetonemia in sequence: in diabetic ketosis or starvation, ketone body production (b-hydroxy-butyrate, acetoacetate) provides fuel for vital organs (heart, brain .) raising the chance of survival of the metabolic catastrophe. However, when ketone body production exceeds the degrading capacity, the accumulating acetoacetic acid presents a new challenge to the pH regulatory system. Acetone production and its further degradation to C3 fragments fulfill two purposes: the maintenance of pH buffering capacity and provision of fuel for peripheral tissues. Since ketosis develops under serious metabolic circumstances, all the mechanisms that balance or moderate the effects of ketosis enhance the chance for survival. From this point of view, the theory that transportable C3 fragments can serve as additional nutrients is a novel view of acetone metabolism which introduces a new approach to the study of acetone degradation, especially in understanding its physiological function and the interrelationship between liver and peripheral tissues. (PMID 10580530). Acetone is typically derived from acetoacetate through the action of microbial acetoacetate decarboxylases found in gut microflora. In chemistry, acetone is the simplest representative of the ketones. Acetone is a colorless, mobile, flammable liquid readily soluble in water, ethanol, ether, etc., and itself serves as an important solvent. Acetone is an irritant and inhalation may lead to hepatotoxic effects (causing liver damage).

59.01373236_MZ	Acetic acid	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Acetic acid is one of the simplest carboxylic acids. It is an important chemical reagent and industrial chemical that is used in the production of plastic soft drink bottles, photographic film; and polyvinyl acetate for wood glue, as well as many synthetic fibres and fabrics. In households diluted acetic acid is often used as a cleaning agent. In the food industry acetic acid is used as an acidity regulator. The acetyl group, derived from acetic acid, is fundamental to the biochemistry of virtually all forms of life. When bound to coenzyme A it is central to the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats. However, the concentration of free acetic acid in cells is kept at a low level to avoid disrupting the control of the pH of the cell contents. Acetic acid is produced and excreted by certain bacteria, notably the Acetobacter genus and Clostridium acetobutylicum. These bacteria are found universally in foodstuffs, water, and soil, and acetic acid is produced naturally as fruits and some other foods spoil. Acetic acid is also a component of the vaginal lubrication of humans and other primates, where it appears to serve as a mild antibacterial agent.

65.03921071_MZ	Ethanol	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Ethanol is a clear, colorless liquid rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and distributed throughout the body. It has bactericidal activity and is used often as a topical disinfectant. It is widely used as a solvent and preservative in pharmaceutical preparations as well as serving as the primary ingredient in alcoholic beverages. Indeed, ethanol has widespread use as a solvent of substances intended for human contact or consumption, including scents, flavorings, colorings, and medicines. Ethanol has a depressive effect on the central nervous system and because of its psychoactive effects, it is considered a drug. Ethanol has a complex mode of action and affects multiple systems in the brain, most notably it acts as an agonist to the GABA receptors. Death from ethanol consumption is possible when blood alcohol level reaches 0.4%. A blood level of 0.5% or more is commonly fatal. Levels of even less than 0.1% can cause intoxication, with unconsciousness often occurring at 0.3-0.4 %. Ethanol is metabolized by the body as an energy-providing carbohydrate nutrient, as it metabolizes into acetyl CoA, an intermediate common with glucose metabolism, that can be used for energy in the citric acid cycle or for biosynthesis. Ethanol within the human body is converted into acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase and then into acetic acid by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. The product of the first step of this breakdown, acetaldehyde, is more toxic than ethanol. Acetaldehyde is linked to most of the clinical effects of alcohol. It has been shown to increase the risk of developing cirrhosis of the liver,[77] multiple forms of cancer, and alcoholism. Industrially, ethanol is produced both as a petrochemical, through the hydration of ethylene, and biologically, by fermenting sugars with yeast. Small amounts of ethanol are endogenously produced by gut microflora through anaerobic fermentation. However most ethanol detected in biofluids and tissues likely comes from consumption of alcoholic beverages. Absolute ethanol or anhydrous alcohol generally refers to purified ethanol, containing no more than one percent water. Absolute alcohol is not intended for human consumption. It often contains trace amounts of toxic benzene (used to remove water by azeotropic distillation). Consumption of this form of ethanol can be fatal over a short time period. Generally absolute or pure ethanol is used as a solvent for lab and industrial settings where water will disrupt a desired reaction. Pure ethanol is classed as 200 proof in the USA and Canada, equivalent to 175 degrees proof in the UK system.

67.02953357_MZ	Imidazole	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Imidazole is a heterocyclic aromatic organic compound. It is further classified as an alkaloid. Imidazole refers to the parent compound C3H4N2, while imidazoles are a class of heterocycles with similar ring structure but varying substituents. This ring system is present in important biological building blocks such as histidine and histamine. Imidazole can act as a base and as a weak acid. Imidazole exists in two tautomeric forms with the hydrogen atom moving between the two nitrogens. Many drugs contain an imidazole ring, such as antifungal drugs and nitroimidazole. Imidazole is a 5 membered planar ring which is soluble in water and polar solvents. Imidazole is a base and an excellent nucleophile. It reacts at the NH nitrogen, attacking alkylating and acylating compounds. It is not particularly susceptible to electrophilic attacks at the carbon atoms, and most of these reactions are substitutions that keep the aromaticity intact. One can see from the resonance structure that the carbon-2 is the carbon most likely to have a nucleophile attack it, but in general nucleophilic substitutions are difficult with imidazole. Imidazole is incorporated into many important biological molecules. The most obvious is the amino acid histidine, which has an imidazole side chain. histidine is present in many proteins and enzymes and plays a vital part in the structure and binding functions of hemoglobin.

70.02977243_MZ	Acrylamide	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Acrylamide (ACR) is a chemical used in many industries around the world and more recently was found to form naturally in foods cooked at high temperatures. Acrylamide is a neurotoxicant, reproductive toxicant, and carcinogen in animal species. Only the neurotoxic effects have been observed in humans and only at high levels of exposure in occupational settings. The mechanism underlying neurotoxic effects of ACR may be basic to the other toxic effects seen in animals. This mechanism involves interference with the kinesin-related motor proteins in nerve cells or with fusion proteins in the formation of vesicles at the nerve terminus and eventual cell death. Neurotoxicity and resulting behavioral changes can affect reproductive performance of ACR-exposed laboratory animals with resulting decreased reproductive performance. Further, the kinesin motor proteins are important in sperm motility, which could alter reproduction parameters. Effects on kinesin proteins could also explain some of the genotoxic effects on ACR. These proteins form the spindle fibers in the nucleus that function in the separation of chromosomes during cell division. This could explain the clastogenic effects of the chemical noted in a number of tests for genotoxicity and assays for germ cell damage. Other mechanisms underlying ACR-induced carcinogenesis or nerve toxicity are likely related to an affinity for sulfhydryl groups on proteins. Binding of the sulfhydryl groups could inactive proteins/enzymes involved in DNA repair and other critical cell functions. Direct interaction with DNA may or may not be a major mechanism for cancer induction in animals. The DNA adducts that form do not correlate with tumor sites and ACR is mostly negative in gene mutation assays except at high doses that may not be achievable in the diet. All epidemiologic studies fail to show any increased risk of cancer from either high-level occupational exposure or the low levels found in the diet. In fact, two of the epidemiologic studies show a decrease in cancer of the large bowel. A number of risk assessment studies were performed to estimate increased cancer risk. The results of these studies are highly variable depending on the model. There is universal consensus among international food safety groups in all countries that examined the issue of ACR in the diet that not enough information is available at this time to make informed decisions on which to base any regulatory action. Too little is known about levels of this chemical in different foods and the potential risk from dietary exposure. Avoidance of foods containing ACR would result in worse health issues from an unbalanced diet or pathogens from under cooked foods. There is some consensus that low levels of ACR in the diet are not a concern for neurotoxicity or reproductive toxicity in humans, although further research is need to study the long-term, low-level cumulative effects on the nervous system. Any relationship to cancer risk from dietary exposure is hypothetical at this point and awaits more definitive studies. (PMID: 17492525).

The average adult ingests 3 to 5 grams of glycine daily. Glycine is involved in the body's production of DNA, phospholipids and collagen, and in release of energy. Glycine levels are effectively measured in plasma in both normal patients and those with inborn errors of glycine metabolism. (http://www.dcnutrition.com/AminoAcids/) Nonketotic hyperglycinaemia (OMIM 606899) is an autosomal recessive condition caused by deficient enzyme activity of the glycine cleavage enzyme system (EC 2.1.1.10). The glycine cleavage enzyme system comprises four proteins: P-, T-, H- and L-proteins (EC 1.4.4.2, EC 2.1.2.10 and EC 1.8.1.4 for P-, T- and L-proteins). Mutations have been described in the GLDC (OMIM 238300), AMT (OMIM 238310), and GCSH (OMIM 238330) genes encoding the P-, T-, and H-proteins respectively. The glycine cleavage system catalyses the oxidative conversion of glycine into carbon dioxide and ammonia, with the remaining one-carbon unit transferred to folate as methylenetetrahydrofolate. It is the main catabolic pathway for glycine and it also contributes to one-carbon metabolism. Patients with a deficiency of this enzyme system have increased glycine in plasma, urine and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with an increased CSF: plasma glycine ratio. (PMID 16151895).

77.00754023_MZ	Dimethyl sulfoxide	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is a key dipolar aprotic solvent. It is less toxic than other members of this class: dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, HMPA. Dimethyl sulfoxide is the chemical compound (CH3)2SO. This colorless liquid is an important dipolar aprotic solvent. It is readily miscible in a wide range of organic solvents as well as water. It has a distinctive property of penetrating the skin very readily, allowing the handler to taste it. Some describe it as an oyster-like taste, others claim it tastes like garlic. DMSO is also employed as a rinsing agent in the electronics industry and, in its deuterated form (DMSO-d6), is a useful solvent in NMR due to its ability to dissolve a wide range of chemical compounds and its minimal interference with the sample signals. In cryobiology DMSO has been used as a cryoprotectant and is still an important constituent of cryoprotectant vitrification mixtures used to preserve organs, tissues, and cell suspensions. It is particularly important in the freezing and long-term storage of embryonic stem cells and hematopoietic stem cell, which are often frozen in a mixture of 10% DMSO and 90% fetal calf serum. As part of an autologous bone marrow transplant the DMSO is re-infused along with the patient's own hematopoietic stem cell. Dimethyl sulfoxide is a by-product of wood pulping. One of the leading suppliers of DMSO is the Gaylord company in the USA. DMSO is frequently used as solvent in a number of chemical reactions. In particular it is an excellent reaction solvent for SN2 alkylations: it is possible to alkylate indoles with very high yields using potassium hydroxide as the base and a similar reaction also occurs with phenols. DMSO can be reacted with methyl iodide to form a sulfoxonium ion which can be reacted with sodium hydride to form a sulfur ylide. The methyl groups of DMSO are somewhat acidic in character (pKa=35) due to the stabilization of the resultant anions by the sulfoxide group.

Butyrate has diverse and apparently paradoxical effects on cellular proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation that may be either pro-neoplastic or anti-neoplastic, depending upon factors such as the level of exposure, availability of other metabolic substrate and the intracellular milieu. In humans, the relationship between luminal butyrate exposure and CRC has been examined only indirectly in case-control studies, by measuring fecal butyrate concentrations, although this may not accurately reflect effective butyrate exposure during carcinogenesis. Perhaps not surprisingly, results of these investigations have been mutually contradictory. The direct effect of butyrate on tumorigenesis has been assessed in a no. of in vivo animal models, which have also yielded conflicting results. In part, this may be explained by methodology: differences in the amount and route of butyrate administration, which are likely to significantly influence delivery of butyrate to the distal colon. (PMID: 16460475) Butyric acid is a carboxylic acid found in rancid butter, parmesan cheese, and vomit, and has an unpleasant odor and acrid taste, with a sweetish aftertaste (similar to ether). Butyric acid is a fatty acid occurring in the form of esters in animal fats and plant oils. Interestingly, low-molecular-weight esters of butyric acid, such as methyl butyrate, have mostly pleasant aromas or tastes. As a consequence, they find use as food and perfume additives. Butyrate is produced as end-product of a fermentation process solely performed by obligate anaerobic bacteria.

It is highly concentrated in muscle and is one of the most important amino acids released by muscle, functioning as a major energy source. Plasma alanine is often decreased when the BCAA (Branched Chain Amino Acids) are deficient. This finding may relate to muscle metabolism. Alanine is highly concentrated in meat products and other high-protein foods like wheat germ and cottage cheese. Alanine is an important participant as well as regulator in glucose metabolism. Alanine levels parallel blood sugar levels in both diabetes and hypoglycemia, and alanine reduces both severe hypoglycemia and the ketosis of diabetes. It is an important amino acid for lymphocyte reproduction and immunity. Alanine therapy has helped dissolve kidney stones in experimental animals. Normal alanine metabolism, like that of other amino acids, is highly dependent upon enzymes that contain vitamin B6. Alanine, like GABA, taurine and glycine, is an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. http://www.dcnutrition.com/AminoAcids/).

It is produced in the body by metabolism of glyoxylic acid or ascorbic acid. It is not metabolized but excreted in the urine. It is used as an analytical reagent and general reducing agent. -- Pubchem; Oxalic acid (IUPAC name: ethanedioic acid, formula H2C2O4) is a dicarboxylic acid with structure (HOOC)-(COOH). Because of the joining of two carboxyl groups, this is one of the strongest organic acids. It is also a reducing agent. The anions of oxalic acid as well as its salts and esters are known as oxalates. -- Wikipedia; Bodily oxalic acid may also be synthesized via the metabolism of either glyoxylic acid or unused ascorbic acid (vitamin C), which is a serious health consideration for long term megadosers of vitamin C supplements. 80% of kidney stones are formed from calcium oxalate. Some Aspergillus species produce oxalic acid, which reacts with blood or tissue calcium to precipitate calcium oxalate. There is some preliminary evidence that the administration of probiotics can affect oxalic acid excretion rates (and presumably oxalic acid levels as well.) -- Wikipedia.

89.02459351_MZ	L-Lactic acid	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Lactic acid plays a role in several biochemical processes and is produced in the muscles during intense activity. Lactate measurement in the critically ill has been traditionally used to stratify patients with poor outcome. However, plasma lactate levels are the result of a finely tuned interplay of factors that affect the balance between its production and its clearance. When the oxygen supply does not match its consumption, organisms such as man who are forced to produce ATP for their integrity adapt in many different ways up to the point when energy failure occurs. Lactate, being part of the adaptive response, may then be used to assess the severity of the supply/demand imbalance. In such a scenario, the time to intervention becomes relevant: early and effective treatment may allow the cell to revert to a normal state, as long as the oxygen machinery (i.e. mitochondria) is intact. Conversely, once the mitochondria are deranged, energy failure occurs even in the presence of normoxia. The lactate increase in critically ill patients may therefore be viewed as an early marker of a potentially reversible state. (PMID 16356243) A number of studies have demonstrated that malignant transformation is associated with an increase in glycolytic flux and in anaerobic and aerobic cellular lactate excretion. Using quantitative bioluminescence imaging in various primary carcinomas in patients (uterine cervix, head and neck, colorectal region) at first diagnosis of the disease, lactate concentrations in tumors in vivo could be relatively low or extremely high (up to 40 micromol/g) in different individual tumors or within the same lesion. In all tumor entities investigated, high molar concentrations of lactate were correlated with a high incidence of distant metastasis already in an early stage of the disease. Low lactate tumors (< median of approximately 8 micromol/g) were associated with both a longer overall and disease free survival compared to high lactate lesions (lactate > approximately 8 micromol/g). Lactate dehydrogenase was found to be upregulated in most of these tumors compared to surrounding normal tissue. (PMID 15279558).

92.05059939_MZ	Aniline	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Aniline is an organic chemical compound, specifically a primary aromatic amine. It consists of a benzene ring attached to an amino group. Aniline is oily and, although colorless, it can be slowly oxidized and resinified in air to form impurities which can give it a red-brown tint. Its boiling point is 184 degree centigrade and its melting point is -6 degree centegrade. It is a liquid at room temperature. Like most volatile amines, it possesses a somewhat unpleasant odour of rotten fish, and also has a burning aromatic taste; it is a highly acrid poison. It ignites readily, burning with a large smoky flame. Aniline reacts with strong acids to form salts containing the anilinium (or phenylammonium) ion (C6H5-NH3+), and reacts with acyl halides (such as acetyl chloride (ethanoyl chloride), CH3COCl) to form amides. The amides formed from aniline are sometimes called anilides, for example CH3-CO-NH-C6H5 is acetanilide, for which the modern name is N-phenyl ethanamide. Like phenols, aniline derivatives are highly reactive in electrophilic substitution reactions. For example, sulfonation of aniline produces sulfanilic acid, which can be converted to sulfanilamide. Sulfanilamide is one of the sulfa drugs which were widely used as antibacterial in the early 20th century. Aniline was first isolated from the destructive distillation of indigo in 1826 by Otto Unverdorben. In 1834, Friedrich Runge isolated from coal tar a substance which produced a beautiful blue color on treatment with chloride of lime; this he named kyanol or cyanol. In 1841, C. J. Fritzsche showed that by treating indigo with caustic potash it yielded an oil, which he named aniline, from the specific name of one of the indigo-yielding plants, Indigofera anil, anil being derived from the Sanskrit, dark-blue.

It is commonly used as an antiseptic and disinfectant. It is active against a wide range of micro-organisms including some fungi and viruses, but is only slowly effective against spores. It has been used to disinfect skin and to relieve itching. Phenol is also used in the preparation of cosmetics including sunscreens, hair dyes, and skin lightening preparations. It is also used in the production of drugs (it is the starting material in the industrial production of aspirin), weedkillers, and synthetic resins. Phenol can be found in areas with high levels of motor traffic, therefore, people living in crowded urban areas are frequently exposed to traffic-derived phenol vapor. The average (mean +/- SD) phenol concentration in urine among normal individuals living in urban areas is 7.4 +/- 2.2 mg/g of creatinine. Exposure of the skin to concentrated phenol solutions causes chemical burns which may be severe; in laboratories where it is used, it is usually recommended that polyethylene glycol solution is kept available for washing off splashes. Notwithstanding the effects of concentrated solutions, it is also used in cosmetic surgery as an exfoliant, to remove layers of dead skin (Wikipedia). In some bacteria phenol can be directly synthesized from tyrosine via the enzyme tyrosine phenol-lyase [EC:4.1.99.2].

97.06560871_MZ	Cyclohexanone	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Cyclohexanone is a colorless oily liquid with an odor resembling acetone and peppermint. Cyclohexanone is occasionally found as a volatile component of human urine. Biological fluids such as blood and urine have been shown to contain a large number of components, some of them volatiles (low boiling point) apparently present in all individuals, while others such are much more variable. In some cases differences up to an order of magnitude are observed. Although some of these changes may have dietary origins, others seem to be characteristic of the individual. Cyclohexanone is obtained through oxidation of cyclohexane or dehydrogenation of phenol. Approx. 95% of its manufacturing is used for the production of nylon. Information on toxicity to human beings is fragmentary. Acute exposure is characterized by irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat. In two persons, drowsiness and renal impairment were found; however, these workers were also exposed to other compounds. Hepatic disorders were found in a group of workers exposed for over five years. In animals, cyclohexanone is characterized by relatively low acute toxicity (DL50 by intragastric administration is approximately 2 g/kg body wt.). Effects on the central nervous system (CNS) were found (narcosis), as well as irritation of the eyes and skin. Following multiple administration, effects were found in the CNS, liver, and kidneys as well as irritation of the conjunctiva. Mutagenic and genotoxic effects were found, but no teratogenic effects were detected; however, there were embryotoxic effects and influence on reproduction Cyclohexanone is well absorbed through the skin, respiratory tract, and alimentary tract. The main metabolic pathway leads to cyclohexanol, which is excreted in urine coupled with glucuronic acid. A high correlation was found between the concentration of cyclohexanone in the working environment and its concentration in urine. Cyclohexanone is formed from the hydrocarbons cyclohexane and 1-, 2-, and 3-hexanol.

101.0245480_MZ	Acetoacetic acid	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Acetoacetic acid is a weak organic acid and can be produced in the human liver under certain conditions of poor metabolism leading to excessive fatty acid breakdown (diabetes mellitus leading to diabetic ketoacidosis), it is then partially converted to acetone by decarboxylation and excreted either in urine or through respiration. Persistent mild hyperketonemia is a common finding in newborns. These compounds serve as an indispensable source of energy for extrahepatic tissues, especially the brain and lung of developing rats. Another important function of ketone bodies is to provide acetoacetyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA for synthesis of cholesterol, fatty acids, and complex lipids. During the early postnatal period, acetoacetate (AcAc) and beta-hydroxybutyrate are preferred over glucose as substrates for synthesis of phospholipids and sphingolipids in accord with requirements for brain growth and myelination. Thus, during the first 2 wk of postnatal development, when the accumulation of cholesterol and phospholipids accelerates, the proportion of ketone bodies incorporated into these lipids increases. On the other hand, an increased proportion of ketone bodies are utilized for cerebroside synthesis during the period of active myelination. In the lung, AcAc serves better than glucose as a precursor for the synthesis of lung phospholipids. The synthesized lipids, particularly dipalmityl phosphatidylcholine, are incorporated into surfactant, and thus have a potential role in supplying adequate surfactant lipids to maintain lung function during the early days of life. (PMID 3884391) The acid is also present in the metabolism of those undergoing starvation or prolonged physical exertion as part of gluconeogenesis. When ketone bodies are measured by way of urine concentration, acetoacetic acid, along with beta-hydroxybutyric acid or acetone, is what is detected.

104.0353471_MZ	L-Serine	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Serine is a nonessential amino acid derived from glycine. Like all the amino acid building blocks of protein and peptides, serine can become essential under certain conditions, and is thus important in maintaining health and preventing disease. Low-average concentration of serine compared to other amino acids is found in muscle. Serine is highly concentrated in all cell membranes. (http://www.dcnutrition.com/AminoAcids/) L-Serine may be derived from four possible sources: dietary intake; biosynthesis from the glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate; from glycine ; and by protein and phospholipid degradation. Little data is available on the relative contributions of each of these four sources of l-serine to serine homoeostasis. It is very likely that the predominant source of l-serine will be very different in different tissues and during different stages of human development. In the biosynthetic pathway, the glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate is converted into phosphohydroxypyruvate, in a reaction catalyzed by 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (3- PGDH; EC 1.1.1.95). Phosphohydroxypyruvate is metabolized to phosphoserine by phosphohydroxypyruvate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.52) and, finally, phosphoserine is converted into l-serine by phosphoserine phosphatase (PSP; EC 3.1.3.3). In liver tissue, the serine biosynthetic pathway is regulated in response to dietary and hormonal changes. Of the three synthetic enzymes, the properties of 3-PGDH and PSP are the best documented. Hormonal factors such as glucagon and corticosteroids also influence 3-PGDH and PSP activities in interactions dependent upon the diet. L-serine plays a central role in cellular proliferation. L-Serine is the predominant source of one-carbon groups for the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides and deoxythymidine monophosphate. It has long been recognized that, in cell cultures, L-serine is a conditional essential amino acid, because it cannot be synthesized in sufficient quantities to meet the cellular demands for its utilization. In recent years, L-serine and the products of its metabolism have been recognized not only to be essential for cell proliferation, but also to be necessary for specific functions in the central nervous system. The findings of altered levels of serine and glycine in patients with psychiatric disorders and the severe neurological abnormalities in patients with defects of L-serine synthesis underscore the importance of L-serine in brain development and function.

105.0332333_MZ	Benzaldehyde	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Benzaldehyde is occasionally found as a volatile component of urine. Benzaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde used in cosmetics as a denaturant, a flavoring agent, and as a fragrance. Currently used in only seven cosmetic products, its highest reported concentration of use was 0.5% in perfumes. Benzaldehyde is a generally regarded as safe (GRAS) food additive in the United States and is accepted as a flavoring substance in the European Union. Because Benzaldehyde rapidly metabolizes to Benzoic Acid in the skin, the available dermal irritation and sensitization data demonstrating no adverse reactions to Benzoic Acid were considered supportive of the safety of Benzaldehyde. Benzaldehyde is absorbed through skin and by the lungs, distributes to all well-perfused organs, but does not accumulate in any specific tissue type. After being metabolized to benzoic acid, conjugates are formed with glycine or glucuronic acid, and excreted in the urine. Several studies have suggested that Benzaldehyde can have carcinostatic or antitumor properties. Overall, at the concentrations used in cosmetics, Benzaldehyde was not considered a carcinogenic risk to humans. Although there are limited irritation and sensitization data available for Benzaldehyde, the available dermal irritation and sensitization data and ultraviolet (UV) absorption and phototoxicity data demonstrating no adverse reactions to Benzoic Acid support the safety of Benzaldehyde as currently used in cosmetic products.

Quinones are oxidized derivatives of aromatic compounds and are often readily made from reactive aromatic compounds with electron-donating substituents such as phenols and catechols, which increase the nucleophilicity of the ring and contributes to the large redox potential needed to break aromaticity. Derivatives of quinones are common constituents of biologically relevant molecules. Some serve as electron acceptors in electron transport chains such as those in photosynthesis (plastoquinone, phylloquinone), and aerobic respiration (ubiquinone). Quinone is a common constituent of biologically relevant molecules (e.g. Vitamin K1 is phylloquinone). A natural example of quinones as oxidizing agents is the spray of bombardier beetles. Hydroquinone is reacted with hydrogen peroxide to produce a fiery blast of steam, a strong deterent in the animal world.

107.0501507_MZ	p-Cresol	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	p-Cresol (4-methylphenol), a 108.1 Da volatile low-molecular-weight compound, is a phenol. It is a partially lipophilic moiety which strongly binds to plasma protein (close to 100%) under normal conditions. p-Cresol is metabolized through conjugation, mainly sulphation and glucuronization, but removal of the unconjugated p-cresol is, at least in part, via the urine. Therefore it is not surprising that this compound, together with several other phenoles, is retained when the kidneys fail. P-Cresol is an end-product of protein breakdown, and an increase of the nutritional protein load in healthy individuals results in enhanced generation and urinary excretion. The serum p-cresol concentration in uremic patients can be decreased by changing to a low-protein diet. p-Cresol is one of the metabolites of the amino acid tyrosine, and to a certain extent also of phenylalanine, which are converted to 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid by intestinal bacteria, before being decarboxylated to p-cresol (putrefaction). The main contributing bacteria are aerobes (mainly enterobacteria), but to a certain extent also anaerobes play a role (mainly Clostridium perfringens). In uremia, modifications in the intestinal flora result in the specific overgrowth of bacteria that are specific p-cresol producers. The administration of antibiotics reduces urinary excretion of p-cresol, as a result of the liquidation of the producing bacteria. Environmental factors might also contribute. The liver cytochrome P450 metabolizes toluene to benzyl alcohol, but also to o-cresol and p-cresol. Toluene is not only used industrially, but it is also the most widely abusively inhaled solvent. Furthermore, p-cresol is a metabolite of menthofuran, one of the metabolites of R-(+)-pulegone, which is found in extracts from the plants Mentha pulegium and Hedeoma pulegioides, commonly known as pennyroyal oil and pennyroyal tea. These extracts are popular as unconventional herbal therapeutic agents and are applied as abortiva, diaphoretics, emmenagogues, and psychedelic drugs. Pennyroyal oil is extensively used for its pleasant mint-like smell in the flavoring industry. The toxicity of pennyroyal oil and menthofuran is well known. Another compound used in traditional medicine, especially in Japan, which is a precursor of p-cresol is wood tar creosote. p-Cresol has been reported to affect several biochemical, biological and physiological functions: (i) it diminishes the oxygen uptake of rat cerebral cortex slices; (ii) it increases the free active drug concentration of warfarin and diazepam; (iii) it has been related to growth retardation in the weanling pig; (iv) it alters cell membrane permeability, at least in bacteria; (v) it induces LDH leakage from rat liver slices; (vi) it induces susceptibility to auditive epileptic crises; and (vii) it blocks cell K+ channels. (PMID: 10570076). p-Cresol is a uremic toxin that is at least partially removed by peritoneal dialysis in haemodialysis patients, and has been involved in the progression of renal failure. (MID: 11169029). At concentrations encountered during uremia, p-cresol inhibits phagocyte function and decreases leukocyte adhesion to cytokine-stimulated endothelial cells. (PMID: 14681860).

109.0294949_MZ	Pyrocatechol	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Pyrocatechol, often known as catechol or benzene-1,2-diol, is a benzenediol, with formula C6H4(OH)2. It was first prepared in 1839 by H. Reinsch by distilling catechin (the juice of Mimosa catechu). This colourless compound occurs naturally, but about 20000 tons are manufactured each year, mainly as precursors to pesticides, flavors, and fragrances. Its sulfonic acid is often present in the urine of many mammals. Small amounts of catechol occur naturally in fruits and vegetables, along with the enzyme polyphenol oxidase. Upon mixing the enzyme with the substrate and exposure to oxygen (as when a potato or apple is cut), the colorless catechol oxidizes to reddish-brown benzoquinone derivatives.

Aldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.3) is the only enzyme in the human liver capable of catalyzing dehydrogenation of aldehydes arising via monoamine, diamine, and plasma amine oxidases. NAD-linked dehydrogenation of short chain aliphatic aldehydes has been found in virtually every organ of the mammalian body. Imidazole-4-acetaldehyde is a good substrate for all aldehyde dehydrogenase isozymes. Experimentally, the prebiotic formation of histidine has been accomplished by the reaction of erythrose with formamidine followed by a Strecker synthesis. Imidazole-4-acetaldehyde could have been converted to histidine on the primitive earth by a Strecker synthesis, and several prebiotic reactions could convert imidazole-4-glycol and imidazole-4-ethanol to imidazole-4-acetaldehyde.

It was first identified as a degradation product of sialic acids, then as a derivative of the oxidation of the D-hydroxyproline isomers by mammalian D-amino acid oxidase. The latter relationship results from the lability of the direct oxidation product, A'-pyrroline-4-hydroxy-2-carboxylic acid, which loses water spontaneously to form the pyrrole. A similar reaction is catalyzed by the more specific allohydroxy-D-proline oxidase of Pseudomonas. In whole animal observations, pyrrole-2-carboxylate (PCA) ' was identified in rat or human urine after administration of the D-isomers of hydroxyproline, a finding ascribable to the action of D-amino acid oxidase.

Creatinine is transferred to the kidneys by blood plasma, whereupon it is eliminated from the body by glomerular filtration and partial tubular excretion. Creatinine is usually produced at a fairly constant rate by the body. Measuring serum creatinine is a simple test and it is the most commonly used indicator of renal function. A rise in blood creatinine levels is observed only with marked damage to functioning nephrons; therefore this test is not suitable for detecting early kidney disease. The typical reference range for women is considered about 45-90 umol/l, for men 60-110 umol/l. Creatine and creatinine are metabolized in the kidneys, muscle, liver and pancreas.

BCAA supplementation as therapy, both oral and intravenous, in human health and disease holds great promise. BCAA denotes valine, isoleucine and leucine which are branched chain essential amino acids. Despite their structural similarities, the branched amino acids have different metabolic routes, with valine going solely to carbohydrates, leucine solely to fats and isoleucine to both. The different metabolism accounts for different requirements for these essential amino acids in humans: 12 mg/kg, 14 mg/kg and 16 mg/kg of valine, leucine and isoleucine respectively. Furthermore, these amino acids have different deficiency symptoms. Valine deficiency is marked by neurological defects in the brain, while isoleucine deficiency is marked by muscle tremors. Many types of inborn errors of BCAA metabolism exist, and are marked by various abnormalities. The most common form is the maple syrup urine disease, marked by a characteristic urinary odor. Other abnormalities are associated with a wide range of symptoms, such as mental retardation, ataxia, hypoglycemia, spinal muscle atrophy, rash, vomiting and excessive muscle movement. Most forms of BCAA metabolism errors are corrected by dietary restriction of BCAA and at least one form is correctable by supplementation with 10 mg of biotin daily. BCAA are decreased in patients with liver disease, such as hepatitis, hepatic coma, cirrhosis, extrahepatic biliary atresia or portacaval shunt; aromatic amino acids (AAA)tyrosine, tryptophan and phenylalanine, as well as methionineare increased in these conditions. Valine in particular, has been established as a useful supplemental therapy to the ailing liver. All the BCAA probably compete with AAA for absorption into the brain. Supplemental BCAA with vitamin B6 and zinc help normalize the BCAA:AAA ratio. (http://www.dcnutrition.com). In sickle-cell disease, valine substitutes for the hydrophilic amino acid glutamic acid in hemoglobin. Because valine is hydrophobic, the hemoglobin does not fold correctly. Valine is an essential amino acid, hence it must be ingested, usually as a component of proteins.

118.0509686_MZ	L-Threonine	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Threonine is an essential amino acid in humans. It is abundant in human plasma, particularly in newborns. Severe deficiency of threonine causes neurological dysfunction and lameness in experimental animals. Threonine is an immunostimulant which promotes the growth of thymus gland. It also can probably promote cell immune defense function. This amino acid has been useful in the treatment of genetic spasticity disorders and multiple sclerosis at a dose of 1 gram daily. It is highly concentrated in meat products, cottage cheese and wheat germ. (http://www.dcnutrition.com/AminoAcids/) The threonine content of most of the infant formulas currently on the market is approximately 20% higher than the threonine concentration in human milk. Due to this high threonine content the plasma threonine concentrations are up to twice as high in premature infants fed these formulas than in infants fed human milk. The whey proteins which are used for infant formulas are sweet whey proteins. Sweet whey results from cheese production. Threonine catabolism in mammals appears to be due primarily (70-80%) to the activity of threonine dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.103) that oxidizes threonine to 2-amino-3-oxobutyrate, which forms glycine and acetyl CoA, whereas threonine dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.16) that catabolizes threonine into 2-oxobutyrate and ammonia, is significantly less active. Increasing the threonine plasma concentrations leads to accumulation of threonine and glycine in the brain. Such accumulation affects the neurotransmitter balance which may have consequences for the brain development during early postnatal life. Thus, excessive threonine intake during infant feeding should be avoided. (PMID 9853925).

The designation vitamin B3 also includes the amide form, nicotinamide or niacinamide. Severe lack of niacin causes the deficiency disease pellagra, whereas a mild deficiency slows down the metabolism decreasing cold tolerance. The recommended daily allowance of niacin is 2-12 mg a day for children, 14 mg a day for women, 16 mg a day for men, and 18 mg a day for pregnant or breast-feeding women. It is found in various animal and plant tissues and has pellagra-curative, vasodilating, and antilipemic properties. The liver can synthesize niacin from the essential amino acid tryptophan (see below), but the synthesis is extremely slow and requires vitamin B6; 60 mg of tryptophan are required to make one milligram of niacin. Bacteria in the gut may also perform the conversion but are inefficient.

124.0073856_MZ	Taurine	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Taurine is a sulfur amino acid like methionine, cystine, cysteine and homocysteine. It is a lesser-known amino acid because it is not incorporated into the structural building blocks of protein. Yet taurine is an essential amino acid in pre-term and newborn infants of humans and many other species. Adults can synthesize their own taurine, yet are probably dependent in part on dietary taurine. Taurine is abundant in the brain, heart, breast, gallbladder and kidney and has important roles in health and disease in these organs. Taurine has many diverse biological functions serving as a neurotransmitter in the brain, a stabilizer of cell membranes and a facilitator in the transport of ions such as sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. Taurine is highly concentrated in animal and fish protein, which are good sources of dietary taurine. It can be synthesized by the body from cysteine when vitamin B6 is present. Deficiency of taurine occurs in premature infants and neonates fed formula milk, and in various disease states. Inborn errors of taurine metabolism have been described. OMIM 168605, an unusual neuropsychiatric disorder inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion through 3 generations of a family. Symptoms began late in the fifth decade in 6 affected persons and death occurred after 4 to 6 years. The earliest and most prominent symptom was mental depression not responsive to antidepressant drugs or electroconvulsive therapy. Sleep disturbances, exhaustion and marked weight loss were features. Parkinsonism developed later, and respiratory failure occurred terminally. OMIM 145350 describes congestive cardiomyopathy and markedly elevated urinary taurine levels (about 5 times normal). Other family members had late or holosystolic mitral valve prolapse and elevated urinary taurine values (about 2.5 times normal). In 2 with mitral valve prolapse, congestive cardiomyopathy eventually developed while the amounts of urinary taurine doubled. Taurine, after GABA, is the second most important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Its inhibitory effect is one source of taurine's anticonvulsant and antianxiety properties. It also lowers glutamic acid in the brain, and preliminary clinical trials suggest taurine may be useful in some forms of epilepsy. Taurine in the brain is usually associated with zinc or manganese. The amino acids alanine and glutamic acid, as well as pantothenic acid, inhibit taurine metabolism while vitamins A and B6, zinc and manganese help build taurine. Cysteine and B6 are the nutrients most directly involved in taurine synthesis. Taurine levels have been found to decrease significantly in many depressed patients. One reason that the findings are not entirely clear is because taurine is often elevated in the blood of epileptics who need it. It is often difficult to distinguish compensatory changes in human biochemistry from true metabolic or deficiency disease. Low levels of taurine are found in retinitis pigmentosa. Taurine deficiency in experimental animals produces degeneration of light-sensitive cells. Therapeutic applications of taurine to eye disease are likely to be forthcoming. Taurine has many important metabolic roles. Supplements can stimulate prolactin and insulin release. The parathyroid gland makes a peptide hormone called glutataurine (glutamic acid-taurine), which further demonstrates taurine's role in endocrinology. Taurine increases bilirubin and cholesterol excretion in bile, critical to normal gallbladder function. It seems to inhibit the effect of morphine and potentiates the effects of opiate antagonists. Low plasma taurine levels have been found in a variety of conditions, i.e., depression, hypertension, hypothyroidism, gout, institutionalized patients, infertility, obesity, kidney failure and others.

128.0714741_MZ	Pipecolic acid	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Pipecolic acid is a metabolite of lysine found in human physiological fluids such as urine, plasma and CSF. However, it is uncertain if pipecolic acid originates directly from food intake or from mammalian or intestinal bacterial enzyme metabolism. Recent studies suggest that plasma pipecolic acid, particularly the D-isomer, originates mainly from the catabolism of dietary lysine by intestinal bacteria rather than by direct food intake. In classic Zellweger syndrome (a cerebro-hepato-renal genetic disorder, OMIM 214100) pipecolic acid accumulate in the plasma of the patients. It is known that plasma pipecolic acid levels are also elevated in patients with chronic liver diseases. Pipecolic acid is moderately elevated in patients with pyridoxine-dependent seizures and might therefore be a possible biochemical marker for selecting candidates for pyridoxine therapy (Plecko et al 2000). Pipecolic acid was also elevated in CSF in these vitamin B6-responsive patients. (PMID 12705501).

Creatine is excreted as creatinine in the urine. Creatine functions as part of the cell's energy shuttle. The high energy phosphate group of ATP is transferred to creatine to form phosphocreatine in the following reaction: Cr + ATP <-> PCr + ADP. This reaction is reversibly catalyzed by creatine kinase. In the human body creatine is synthesized mainly in the liver by the use of parts from three different amino acids - arginine, glycine, and methionine. 95% of it is later stored in the skeletal muscles, with the rest in the brain, heart, testes.

130.0873871_MZ	L-Leucine	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Branched chain amino acids (BCAA) are essential amino acids whose carbon structure is marked by a branch point. These three amino acids are critical to human life and are particularly involved in stress, energy and muscle metabolism. BCAA supplementation as therapy, both oral and intravenous, in human health and disease holds great promise. 'BCAA' denotes valine, isoleucine and leucine which are branched chain essential amino acids. Despite their structural similarities, the branched amino acids have different metabolic routes, with valine going solely to carbohydrates, leucine solely to fats and isoleucine to both. The different metabolism accounts for different requirements for these essential amino acids in humans: 12 mg/kg, 14 mg/kg and 16 mg/kg of valine, leucine and isoleucine respectively. Furthermore, these amino acids have different deficiency symptoms. Valine deficiency is marked by neurological defects in the brain, while isoleucine deficiency is marked by muscle tremors. Many types of inborn errors of BCAA metabolism exist, and are marked by various abnormalities. The most common form is the maple syrup urine disease, marked by a characteristic urinary odor. Other abnormalities are associated with a wide range of symptoms, such as mental retardation, ataxia, hypoglycemia, spinal muscle atrophy, rash, vomiting and excessive muscle movement. Most forms of BCAA metabolism errors are corrected by dietary restriction of BCAA and at least one form is correctable by supplementation with 10 mg of biotin daily. BCAA are useful because they are metabolized primarily by muscle. Stress state- e.g surgery, trauma, cirrhosis, infections, fever and starvation--require proportionately more BCAA than other amino acids and probably proportionately more leucine than either valine or isoleucine. BCAA and other amino acids are frequently fed intravenously (TPN) to malnourished surgical patients and in some cases of severe trauma. BCAA, particularly leucine, stimulate protein synthesis, increase reutilization of amino acids in many organs and reduce protein breakdown. Furthermore, leucine can be an important source of calories, and is superior as fuel to the ubiquitous intravenous glucose (dextrose). Leucine also stimulates insulin release, which in turn stimulates protein synthesis and inhibits protein breakdown. These effects are particularly useful in athletic training. BCAA should also replace the use of steroids as commonly used by weightlifters. Huntington's chorea and anorexic disorders both are characterized by low serum BCAA. These diseases, as well as forms of Parkinson's, may respond to BCAA therapy. BCAA, and particularly leucine, are among the amino acids most essential for muscle health. (http://www.dcnutrition.com).

131.0461975_MZ	L-Asparagine	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Asparagine (Asn) is one of the 20 most common natural amino acids on Earth. It has carboxamide as the side chain's functional group. It is considered a non-essential amino acid. Asparagine is not an essential amino acid, which means that it can be synthesized from central metabolic pathway intermediates in humans and is not required in the diet. The precursor to asparagine is oxaloacetate. Oxaloacetate is converted to aspartate using a transaminase enzyme. The enzyme transfers the amino group from glutamate to oxaloacetate producing alpha-ketoglutarate and aspartate. The enzyme asparagine synthetase produces asparagine, AMP, glutamate, and pyrophosphate from aspartate, glutamine, and ATP. In the asparagine synthetase reaction, ATP is used to activate aspartate, forming beta-aspartyl-AMP. glutamine donates an ammonium group which reacts with beta-aspartyl-AMP to form asparagine and free AMP. Since the asparagine side chain can make efficient hydrogen bond interactions with the peptide backbone, asparagines are often found near the beginning and end of alpha-helices, and in turn motifs in beta sheets. Its role can be thought as capping the hydrogen bond interactions which would otherwise need to be satisfied by the polypeptide backbone. glutamines have an extra methylene group, have more conformational entropy and thus are less useful in this regard. Asparagine also provides key sites for N-linked glycosylation, modification of the protein chain with the addition of carbohydrate chains. A reaction between asparagine and reducing sugars or reactive carbonyls produces acrylamide (acrylic amide) in food when heated to sufficient temperature, i.e. baking. These occur primarily in baked goods such as french fries, potato chips, and roasted coffee. Asparagine was first isolated in 1806 from asparagus juice, in which it is abundant--hence its name--becoming the first amino acid to be isolated. The smell observed in the urine of some individuals after their consumption of asparagus is attributed to a byproduct of the metabolic breakdown of asparagine, asparagine-amino-succinic-acid monoamide. (However, some scientists disagree and implicate other substances in the smell, especially methanethiol). (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asparagine).

It is a central part of the urea cycle, which allows for the disposal of excess nitrogen. L-Ornithine is also a precursor of citrulline and arginine. In order for ornithine produced in the cytosol to be converted to citrulline, it must first cross the inner mitochondrial membrane into the mitochondrial matrix where it is carbamylated by ornithine transcarbamylase. This transfer is mediated by the mitochondrial ornithine transporter (SLC25A15; AF112968; ORNT1). Mutations in the mitochondrial ornithine transporter result in hyperammonemia, hyperornithinemia, homocitrullinuria (HHH) syndrome, a disorder of the urea cycle. (PMID 16256388) The pathophysiology of the disease may involve diminished ornithine transport into mitochondria, resulting in ornithine accumulation in the cytoplasm and reduced ability to clear carbamoyl phosphate and ammonia loads.

132.0302377_MZ	L-Aspartic acid	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Aspartic acid (Asp, D), also known as aspartate, the name of its anion, is one of the 20 natural proteinogenic amino acids which are the building blocks of proteins. As its name indicates, aspartic acid is the carboxylic acid analog of asparagine. As a neurotransmitter, aspartic acid may provide resistance to fatigue and thus lead to endurance, although the evidence to support this idea is not strong. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartic_acid) Aspartic acid is a nonessential amino acid which is made from glutamic acid by enzymes using vitamin B6. The amino acid has important roles in the urea cycle and DNA metabolism. Aspartic acid is a major excitatory neurotransmitter, which is sometimes found to be increased in epileptic and stroke patients. It is decreased in depressed patients and in patients with brain atrophy. Aspartic acid supplements are being evaluated. Five grams can raise blood levels. Magnesium and zinc may be natural inhibitors of some of the actions of aspartic acid. Aspartic acid, with the amino acid phenylalanine, is a part of a new natural sweetener, aspartame. This sweetener is an advance in artificial sweeteners, and is probably safe in normal doses to all except phenylketonurics. The jury is still out on the long term effects it has on many brain neurohormones. Aspartic acid may be a significant immunostimulant of the thymus and can protect against some of the damaging effects of radiation. Many claims have been made for the special value of administering aspartic acid in the form of potassium and magnesium salts. Since aspartic acid is relatively nontoxic, studies are now in progress to elucidate its pharmacological and therapeutic roles. (http://www.dcnutrition.com/AminoAcids).

133.0142794_MZ	L-Malic acid	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Malic acid is a tart-tasting organic dicarboxylic acid that plays a role in many sour or tart foods. Apples contain malic acid, which contributes to the sourness of a green apple. Malic acid can make a wine taste tart, although the amount decreases with increasing fruit ripeness. (wikipedia). In its ionized form malic acid is called malate. Malate is an intermediate of the TCA cycle along with fumarate. It can also be formed from pyruvate as one of the anaplerotic reactions. In humans, malic acid is both derived from food sources and synthesized in the body through the citric acid cycle or Krebs cycle which takes place in the mitochondria. Malate's importance to the production of energy in the body during both aerobic and anaerobic conditions is well established. Under aerobic conditions, the oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate provides reducing equivalents to the mitochondria through the malate-aspartate redox shuttle. During anaerobic conditions, where a buildup of excess of reducing equivalents inhibits glycolysis, malic acid's simultaneous reduction to succinate and oxidation to oxaloacetate is capable of removing the accumulating reducing equivalents. This allows malic acid to reverse hypoxia's inhibition of glycolysis and energy production. In studies on rats it has been found that only tissue malate is depleted following exhaustive physical activity. Other key metabolites from the citric acid cycle needed for energy production were found to be unchanged. Because of this, a deficiency of malic acid has been hypothesized to be a major cause of physical exhaustion. Notably, the administration of malic acid to rats has been shown to elevate mitochondrial malate and increase mitochondrial respiration and energy production.

135.0451688_MZ	Phenylacetic acid	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Phenyl acetate (or phenylacetate) is a carboxylic acid ester that has been found in the biofluids of patients with nephritis and/or hepatitis as well as patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Excess phenylalanine in the body can be disposed of through a transamination process leading to the production of phenylpyruvate. The phenylpyruvate can be further metabolized into a number of products. Decarboxylation of phenylpyruvate gives phenylacetate, while a reduction reaction gives phenyllactate. The phenylacetate can be further conjugated with glutamine to give phenylacetyl glutamine. All of these metabolites can be detected in serum and urine of PKU patients. Phenyl acetate is also produced endogenously as the metabolite of 2-Phenylethylamine, which is mainly metabolized by monoamine oxidase to form phenyl acetate. 2-phenylethylamine is an endogenous amphetamine which may modulate central adrenergic functions, and the urinary phenyl acetate levels have been postulated as a marker for depression. (PMID: 17978765, 476920, 6857245). Phenylacetate is also found in essential oils, e.g. neroli, rose oil, free and as esters' and in many fruits. As a result it is used as a perfumery and flavoring ingredient.

137.0357944_MZ	Urocanic acid	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Urocanic acid is a breakdown (deamination) product of histidine. In the liver, urocanic acid is an intermediate in the conversion of histidine to glutamic acid, whereas in the epidermis, it accumulates and may be both a UV protectant and an immunoregulator. Urocanic acid (UA) exists as a trans isomer (t-UA, approximately 30 mg/cm2) in the uppermost layer of the skin (stratum corneum). t-UA is formed as the cells of the second layer of skin become metabolically inactive. During this process, proteins and membranes degrade, histidine is released, and histidase (histidine ammonia lyase) catalyzes the deamination of histidine to form t-UA. t-UA accumulates in the epidermis until removal by either the monthly skin renewal cycle or sweat. Upon absorption of UV light, the naturally occurring t-UA isomerizes to its cis form, c-UA. Because DNA lesions (e.g., pyrimidine dimers) in the lower epidermis can result from UV-B absorption, initial research proposed that t-UA acted as a natural sunscreen absorbing UV-B in the stratum corneum before the damaging rays could penetrate into lower epidermal zones. Researchers have found that c-UA also suppresses contact hypersensitivity and delayed hypersensitivity, reduces the Langerhans cell count in the epidermis, prolongs skin-graft survival time, and affects natural killer cell activity.

The presence of tyrosol has been described in red and white wines. Tyrosol is also present in vermouth and beer. Tyrosol has been shown to be able to exert antioxidant activity in vitro studies. Oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) appears to occur predominantly in arterial intimae in microdomains sequestered from antioxidants of plasma. The antioxidant content of the LDL particle is critical for its protection. The ability of tyrosol to bind human LDL has been reported. The bioavailability of tyrosol in humans from virgin olive oil in its natural form has been demonstrated. Urinary tyrosol increases, reaching a peak at 0-4 h after virgin olive oil administration. Men and women show a different pattern of urinary excretion of tyrosol. Moreover, tyrosol is absorbed in a dose-dependent manner after sustained and moderate doses of virgin olive oil. Tyrosol from wine or virgin olive oil could exert beneficial effects on human health in vivo if its biological properties are confirmed. (PMID 15134375).

In certain cases the measurement of these metabolites in body fluids can be used to diagnose disorders associated with mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation. Acyl glycines are produced through the action of glycine N-acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.13) which is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction:. acyl-CoA + glycine < -- > CoA + N-acylglycine. Vinylacetylglycine is a human metabolite that had been identified in a GC/MS urine screen. Increased amounts of this metabolite in the urine has been linked to a metabolomic disorder termed Isovaleric acidemia. (Gas-Chromatographic Method of Analysis for Urinary Organic Acids. I.

144.1029393_MZ	3-Dehydroxycarnitine	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	3-Dehydroxycarnitine is an acylcarnitine. Numerous disorders have been described that lead to disturbances in energy production and in intermediary metabolism in the organism which are characterized by the production and excretion of unusual acylcarnitines. A mutation in the gene coding for carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase or the OCTN2 transporter aetiologically causes a carnitine deficiency that results in poor intestinal absorption of dietary L-carnitine, its impaired reabsorption by the kidney and, consequently, in increased urinary loss of L-carnitine. Determination of the qualitative pattern of acylcarnitines can be of diagnostic and therapeutic importance. The betaine structure of carnitine requires special analytical procedures for recording. The ionic nature of L-carnitine causes a high water solubility which decreases with increasing chain length of the ester group in the acylcarnitines. Therefore, the distribution of L-carnitine and acylcarnitines in various organs is defined by their function and their physico-chemical properties as well. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) permits screening for free and total carnitine, as well as complete quantitative acylcarnitine determination, including the long-chain acylcarnitine profile.

145.0619989_MZ	L-Glutamine	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Glutamine (Gln) is one of the 20 amino acids encoded by the standard genetic code. Its side chain is an amide; it is formed by replacing a side-chain hydroxyl of glutamic acid with an amine functional group. glutamine is found in foods high in proteins, such as fish, red meat, beans, and dairy products. glutamine is a supplement that is used in weightlifting, bodybuilding, endurance and other sports, as well as by those who suffer from muscular cramps or pain particularly elderly people. The main use of glutamine within the diet of either group is as a means of replenishing the body's stores of amino acids that have been used during exercise or everyday activities. Studies which are looking into problems with excessive consumption of glutamine thus far have proved inconclusive. However, normal supplementation is healthy mainly because glutamine is supposed to be supplemented after prolonged periods of exercise (for example, a workout or exercise in which amino acids are required for use) and replenishes amino acid stores; this being the main reason glutamine is recommended during fasting or for people who suffer from physical trauma, immune deficiencies, or cancer. There is a significant body of evidence that links glutamine-enriched diets with intestinal effects; aiding maintenance of gut barrier function, intestinal cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as generally reducing septic morbidity and the symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome. The reason for such cleansing properties is thought to stem from the fact that the intestinal extraction rate of glutamine is higher than that for other amino acids, and is therefore thought to be the most viable option when attempting to alleviate conditions relating to the gastrointestinal tract. These conditions were discovered after comparing plasma concentration within the gut between glutamine-enriched and non glutamine-enriched diets. However, even though glutamine is thought to have cleansing properties and effects, it is unknown to what extent glutamine has clinical benefits, due to the varied concentrations of glutamine in varieties of food. It is also known that glutamine has various effects in reducing healing time after operations. Hospital waiting times after abdominal surgery are reduced by providing parenteral nutrition regimens containing amounts of glutamine to patients. Clinical trials have revealed that patients on supplementation regimes containing glutamine have improved nitrogen balances, generation of cysteinyl-leukotrienes from polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes and improved lymphocyte recovery and intestinal permeability (in postoperative patients) - in comparison to those who had no glutamine within their dietary regime; all without any side-effects.

145.0981660_MZ	L-Lysine	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	L-lysine is an essential amino acid. Normal requirements for lysine have been found to be about 8 g per day or 12 mg/kg in adults. Children and infants need more- 44 mg/kg per day for an eleven to-twelve-year old, and 97 mg/kg per day for three-to six-month old. Lysine is highly concentrated in muscle compared to most other amino acids. Lysine is high in foods such as wheat germ, cottage cheese and chicken. Of meat products, wild game and pork have the highest concentration of lysine. Fruits and vegetables contain little lysine, except avocados. Normal lysine metabolism is dependent upon many nutrients including niacin, vitamin B6, riboflavin, vitamin C, glutamic acid and iron. Excess arginine antagonizes lysine. Several inborn errors of lysine metabolism are known. Most are marked by mental retardation with occasional diverse symptoms such as absence of secondary sex characteristics, undescended testes, abnormal facial structure, anemia, obesity, enlarged liver and spleen, and eye muscle imbalance. Lysine also may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of osteoporosis. Although high protein diets result in loss of large amounts of calcium in urine, so does lysine deficiency. Lysine may be an adjunct therapy because it reduces calcium losses in urine. Lysine deficiency also may result in immunodeficiency. Requirements for this amino acid are probably increased by stress. Lysine toxicity has not occurred with oral doses in humans. Lysine dosages are presently too small and may fail to reach the concentrations necessary to prove potential therapeutic applications. Lysine metabolites, amino caproic acid and carnitine have already shown their therapeutic potential. Thirty grams daily of amino caproic acid has been used as an initial daily dose in treating blood clotting disorders, indicating that the proper doses of lysine, its precursor, have yet to be used in medicine. Low lysine levels have been found in patients with Parkinson's, hypothyroidism, kidney disease, asthma and depression. The exact significance of these levels is unclear, yet lysine therapy can normalize the level and has been associated with improvement of some patients with these conditions. Abnormally elevated hydroxylysines have been found in virtually all chronic degenerative diseases and coumadin therapy. The levels of this stress marker may be improved by high doses of vitamin C. Lysine is particularly useful in therapy for marasmus (wasting) and herpes simplex. It stops the growth of herpes simplex in culture, and has helped to reduce the number and occurrence of cold sores in clinical studies. Dosing has not been adequately studied, but beneficial clinical effects occur in doses ranging from 100 mg to 4 g a day. Higher doses may also be useful, and toxicity has not been reported in doses as high as 8 g per day. Diets high in lysine and low in arginine can be useful in the prevention and treatment of herpes. Some researchers think herpes simplex virus is involved in many other diseases related to cranial nerves such as migraines, Bell's palsy and Meniere's disease. Herpes blister fluid will produce fatal encephalitis in the rabbit. (http://www.dcnutrition.com).

146.0459018_MZ	L-Glutamic acid	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Glutamic acid (Glu), also referred to as glutamate (the anion), is one of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids. It is not among the essential amino acids. Glutamate is a key molecule in cellular metabolism. In humans, dietary proteins are broken down by digestion into amino acids, which serves as metabolic fuel or other functional roles in the body. Glutamate is the most abundant fast excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian nervous system. At chemical synapses, glutamate is stored in vesicles. Nerve impulses trigger release of glutamate from the pre-synaptic cell. In the opposing post-synaptic cell, glutamate receptors, such as the NMDA receptor, bind glutamate and are activated. Because of its role in synaptic plasticity, it is believed that glutamic acid is involved in cognitive functions like learning and memory in the brain. Glutamate transporters are found in neuronal and glial membranes. They rapidly remove glutamate from the extracellular space. In brain injury or disease, they can work in reverse and excess glutamate can accumulate outside cells. This process causes calcium ions to enter cells via NMDA receptor channels, leading to neuronal damage and eventual cell death, and is called excitotoxicity. The mechanisms of cell death include: * Damage to mitochondria from excessively high intracellular Ca2+. * Glu/Ca2+-mediated promotion of transcription factors for pro-apoptotic genes, or downregulation of transcription factors for anti-apoptotic genes. Excitotoxicity due to glutamate occurs as part of the ischemic cascade and is associated with stroke and diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, lathyrism, and Alzheimer's disease. glutamic acid has been implicated in epileptic seizures. Microinjection of glutamic acid into neurons produces spontaneous depolarization around one second apart, and this firing pattern is similar to what is known as paroxysmal depolarizing shift in epileptic attacks. This change in the resting membrane potential at seizure foci could cause spontaneous opening of voltage activated calcium channels, leading to glutamic acid release and further depolarization.

It is an intermediate in the pentose and glucuronate interconversion pathway and can be formed from either D-xylonic acid or D-xylose. D-xylose is a simple 5 carbon sugar that is found in a variety of edible plants. It is also frequently used in intestinal absorption tests to help diagnose problems that prevent the small intestine from absorbing nutrients in food. Xylose is also the first saccharide added to the serine or threonine in the proteoglycan type O-glycosylation and so it is the first saccharide in biosynthetic pathways of most anionic polysaccharides such as heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate.

147.0662557_MZ	Mevalonic acid	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Mevalonic acid is a key organic compound in biochemistry. It is a precursor in the biosynthetic pathway, known as the HMG-CoA reductase pathway, that produces terpenes and steroids. Mevalonate is produced by NADPH from 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA via reduction. This reaction occurs in the cytosol. It is the committed step in cholesterol synthesis, -- Wikipedia The production of mevalonic acid (MVA) by the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, is the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol. (Jemal et. al, Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry, 2003, 17:1715) Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion of MVA are decreased by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor drugs such as pravastatin, simvastatin and atorvastatin.

148.0438526_MZ	L-Methionine	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Methionine is a dietary indispensable amino acid required for normal growth and development of humans, other mammals, and avian species. In addition to being a substrate for protein synthesis, it is an intermediate in transmethylation reactions, serving as the major methyl group donor in vivo, including the methyl groups for DNA and RNA intermediates. Methionine is a methyl acceptor for 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyl transferase (methionine synthase), the only reaction that allows for the recycling of this form of folate, and is also a methyl acceptor for the catabolism of betaine. Methionine is also required for synthesis of cysteine. Methionine is accepted as the metabolic precursor for cysteine. Only the sulfur atom from methionine is transferred to cysteine; the carbon skeleton of cysteine is donated by serine. (PMID 16702340). The adequacy range of dietary requirements of specific amino acids in disease states is difficult to determine. Requirements may not be similar in disease with regard to protein synthesis. Requirements for this purpose can be assessed only when such a function can be measured and related to clinical outcome. There is apparent consensus concerning normal sulfur amino acid (SAA) requirements. WHO recommendations amount to 13 mg/kg per 24 h in healthy adults. This amount is roughly doubled in artificial nutrition regimens. In disease or after trauma, requirements may be altered for methionine, cysteine, and taurine. Although in specific cases of congenital enzyme deficiency, prematurity, or diminished liver function, hypermethionemia or hyperhomocysteinemia may occur, SAA supplementation can be considered safe in amounts exceeding 2-3 times the minimal recommended daily intake. Apart from some very specific indications (e.g., acetaminophen poisoning) the usefulness of SAA supplementation is not yet established.(PMID 16702341). Methionine is known to exacerbate psychopathological symptoms in schizophrenic patients, there is no evidence of similar effects in healthy subjects. The role of methionine as a precursor of homocysteine is the most notable cause for concern. A loading dose of methionine (0.1 g/kg) has been given, and the resultant acute increase in plasma homocysteine has been used as an index of the susceptibility to cardiovascular disease. Although this procedure results in vascular dysfunction, this is acute and unlikely to result in permanent damage. However, a 10-fold larger dose, given mistakenly, resulted in death. Longer-term studies in adults have indicated no adverse consequences of moderate fluctuations in dietary methionine intake, but intakes higher than 5 times normal resulted in elevated homocysteine levels. These effects of methionine on homocysteine and vascular function are moderated by supplements of vitamins B-6, B-12, C, and folic acid. In infants, methionine intakes of 2 to 5 times normal resulted in impaired growth and extremely high plasma methionine levels, but no adverse long-term consequences were observed. (PMID 16702346).

148.0626493_MZ	6-Methyladenine	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	6-Methyladenine is a methylated adenine residue. The formation of internal 6-methyladenine (m6A) residues in eucaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA) is a postsynthetic modification in which S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) serves as the methyl donor. 6-Methyladenine residues have also been localized to heterogeneous nuclear RNA (HnRNA), and for the most part these residues are conserved during mRNA processing. Although the biological significance of internal adenine methylation in eucaryotic mRNA remains unclear, a great deal of research has indicated that this modification may be required for mRNA transport to the cytoplasm, the selection of splice sites or other RNA processing reactions. The presence of m6A residues increases the in vitro translation efficiency of dihydrofolate reductase; an inhibition of m6A residues in dihydrofolate reductase transcripts significantly alters their rate of translation. m6A is found in many human fluids: oviductal fluid, blood plasma and urine.

149.0456494_MZ	D-Ribose	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	D-ribose is commonly referred to simply as ribose, a five-carbon sugar found in all living cells. Ribose is not an essential nutrient because it can be synthesized by almost every tissue in the body from other substances, such as glucose. It is vital for life as a component of DNA, RNA, ATP, ADP, and AMP. In nature, small amounts of ribose can be found in ripe fruits and vegetables. Brewer's yeast, which has a high concentration of RNA, is another rich source of ribose. D-ribose is also a component of many so-called energy drinks and antiaging products available on the market today. Ribose is a structural component of ATP, which is the primary energy source for exercising muscle. The adenosine component is an adenine base attached to the five-carbon sugar ribose. ATP provides energy to working muscles by releasing a phosphate group, hence becoming ADP, which in turn may release a phosphate group, then becoming AMP. During intense muscular activity, the total amount of ATP available is quickly depleted. In an effort to correct this imbalance, AMP is broken down in the muscle and secreted from the cell. Once the breakdown products of AMP are released from the cell, the energy potential (TAN pool) of the muscle is reduced and ATP must then be reformed using ribose. Ribose helps restore the level of adenine nucleotides by bypassing the rate-limiting step in the de novo (oxidative pentose phosphate) pathway, which regenerates 5-phosphoribosyl-l-pyrophosphate (PRPP), the essential precursor for ATP. If ribose is not readily available to a cell, glucose may be converted to ribose. Ribose supplementation has been shown to increase the rate of ATP resynthesis following intense exercise. The use of ribose in men with severe coronary artery disease resulted in improved exercise tolerance. Hence, there is interest in the potential of ribose supplements to boost muscular performance in athletic activities. (PMID: 17618002, Curr Sports Med Rep. 2007 Jul;6(4):254-7.).

154.0621843_MZ	L-Histidine	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Histidine is an alpha-amino acid with an imidazole functional group. It is one of the 22 proteinogenic amino acids. Histidine was first isolated by German physician Albrecht Kossel in 1896. Histidine is an essential amino acid in humans and other mammals. It was initially thought that it was only essential for infants, but longer-term studies established that it is also essential for adults. Infants four to six months old require 33 mg/kg of histidine. It is not clear how adults make small amounts of histidine, and dietary sources probably account for most of the histidine in the body. Histidine is a precursor for histamine and carnosine biosynthesis. Inborn errors of histidine metabolism exist and are marked by increased histidine levels in the blood. Elevated blood histidine is accompanied by a wide range of symptoms, from mental and physical retardation to poor intellectual functioning, emotional instability, tremor, ataxia and psychosis. Histidine and other imidazole compounds have anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-secretory properties (PMID: 9605177). The efficacy of L-histidine in protecting inflamed tissue is attributed to the capacity of the imidazole ring to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by cells during acute inflammatory response (PMID: 9605177). Histidine, when administered in therapeutic quantities is able to inhibit cytokines and growth factors involved in cell and tissue damage (US patent 6150392). Histidine in medical therapies has its most promising trials in rheumatoid arthritis where up to 4.5 g daily have been used effectively in severely affected patients. Arthritis patients have been found to have low serum histidine levels, apparently because of very rapid removal of histidine from their blood (PMID: 1079527). Other patients besides arthritis patients that have been found to be low in serum histidine are those with chronic renal failure. Urinary levels of histidine are reduced in pediatric patients with pneumonia. (PMID: 2084459). Asthma patients exhibit increased serum levels of histidine over normal controls (PMID: 23517038).  Serum histidine levels are lower and are negatively associated with inflammation and oxidative stress in obese women (PMID: 23361591).  Histidine supplementation has been shown to reduce insulin resistance, reduce BMI and fat mass and suppress inflammation and oxidative stress in obese women with metabolic syndrome.  Histidine appears to suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, possibly via the NF-B pathway, in adipocytes (PMID: 23361591). Low plasma concentrations of histidine are associated with protein-energy wasting, inflammation, oxidative stress, and greater mortality in chronic kidney disease patients (PMID: 18541578). Histidine may have many other possible functions because it is the precursor of the ubiquitous neurohormone-neurotransmitter histamine. Histidine increases histamine in the blood and probably in the brain. Low blood histamine with low serum histidine occurs in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Low blood histamine also occurs in some manic, schizophrenic, high copper and hyperactive groups of psychiatric patients. Histidine is a useful therapy in all patients with low histamine levels.

Overexpression of the Alpha class GSTs in cells leads to lower steady-state levels of HNE, and these cells acquire resistance to apoptosis induced by lipid peroxidation-causing agents such as H(2)O(2), UVA, superoxide anion, and pro-oxidant xenobiotics, suggesting that signaling for apoptosis by these agents is transduced through HNE. Cells with the capacity to exclude HNE from the intracellular environment at a faster rate are relatively more resistant to apoptosis caused by H(2)O(2), UVA, superoxide anion, and pro-oxidant xenobiotics as well as by HNE, suggesting that HNE may be a common denominator in mechanisms of apoptosis caused by oxidative stress. Transfection of adherent cells with HNE-metabolizing GSTs leads to transformation of these cells due to depletion of HNE. (PMID 15288119).

It is a product of purine metabolism in most mammals except higher apes, and it is present in their urine. In humans, uric acid is excreted instead of allantoin. The presence of allantoin in the urine can be an indication of microbial overgrowth or it can be created via non-enzymatic means through high levels of reactive oxygen species. In this regard Allantoin is sometimes used as a marker of oxidative stress. Allantoin can be isolated from cow urine or as a botanical extract of the comfrey plant. It has long been used for its healing, soothing, and anti-irritating properties. Allantoin helps to heal wounds and skin irritations and stimulates the growth of healthy tissue. Allantoin can be found in anti-acne products, sun care products, and clarifying lotions because of its ability to help heal minor wounds and promote healthy skin. Allantoin is frequently present in toothpaste, mouthwash, and other oral hygiene products as well as shampoos, lipsticks, various cosmetic lotions and creams and other cosmetic and pharmaceutical products.

The isolated excretion of high levels of 2-methylbutyrylglycine (2-MBG) is the hallmark of short/branched-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency or SBCADD (PMID:15615815). The disorder is also called 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (PMID: 17883863) and has been associated with autism and mental retardation. SBCADD is a recently described autosomal recessive disorder caused by a defect in the degradation pathway of L- isoleucine leading to increased urinary excretion of 2-methylbutyryl glycine. The enzymatic defect results from disruption of the SBCAD gene. Deficiency of SBCAD leads to accumulation of its substrate, 2-methylbutyryl-CoA within the mitochondrion. This substance is transesterified with glycine by the mitochondrial enzyme acyl-CoA glycine-N-acyltransferase (glycine-N-acylase) to form 2-methylbutyryl glycine. Affected patients can be divided into two categories. The first category consists of infants detected by newborn screening programmes. These infants are treated with diet and remain without clinical symptoms. In the second category affected patients are diagnosed because they presented clinically with seizures and psychomotor delay and have increased urinary excretion of 2-methylbutyryl glycine (PMID: 17883863). 2-methylbutyrylglycine has also been found in the urine of patients with propionyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency after consuming isoleucine. (PMID: 630060). 2-methylbutyrylglycine is also elevated in the urine of patients with glutaric aciduria II and ethylmalonic encephalopathy.

159.0564295_MZ	Methylimidazoleacetic acid	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Methylimidazoleacetic acid is the main metabolite of histamine. This end product of histamine catabolism is formed by N-methylation in the imidazole ring to methylhistamine by histamine methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.8) and a subsequent oxidative deamination in the side chain by type B monoamine oxidase (EC 1.4.3.4). From studies is known that as much as 70 to 80 percent of the histamine metabolized in the body is excreted in the urine as Methylimidazoleacetic acid. Thus, urinary Methylimidazoleacetic acid being the major and specific histamine metabolite is a clear marker of any changes in histamine metabolism in the body. The urinary excretion of methylimidazoleacetic acid is considered a reliable indicator of histamine turnover rate in the body. The excretion of Methylimidazoleacetic acid is higher in men than women however; this gender difference is abolished when corrected for creatinine excretion. A possible explanation is that basal histamine turnover is related to body size. There is no significant difference in Methylimidazoleacetic acid excretion between smokers and non-smokers when analysing absolute values (mg/24 h).

Patients with adult Refsums disease (ARD) are unable to detoxify phytanic acid by alpha-oxidation, and so the w-oxidation pathway is the only metabolic pathway available for phytanic acid degradation. This pathway produces 3-methyladipic acid as the final metabolite, which is excreted in the urine (Wanders et al. 2001). Activity of the w-oxidation pathway is approximately doubled in ARD patients compared with normal individuals (PMID: 11948235).

N-monomethyl-lysine is generated by metabolic transmethylation of endogenous lysine. Lysine methylation displays the highest degree of complexity among known covalent histone modifications, with each site of methylation regulating the association of different effector molecules. The versatility of lysine methylation marks is perhaps best exemplified by modifications implicated in transcriptional regulation as well as being required for double-strand break repair in several organisms. Identification of the numerous biological functions encoded by histone lysine methylation is a major area of research interest, as these mechanisms are intimately associated with cellular senescence, genomic instability, and leukemogenesis. While multiple sites of lysine methylation have been linked with gene activation, each modification is distributed to unique positions across the active gene.

It is an intermediate in the metabolism (i.e. breakdown or degradation) of lysine and saccharopine.(Wikipedia).   It antagonizes neuroexcitatory activity modulated by the glutamate receptor, N-methyl-D-aspartate; (NMDA). Aminoadipic has also been shown to inhibit the production of kynurenic acid in brain tissue slices (PMID: 8566117). Kynurenic acid is a broad spectrum excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist. Recent studies have shown that aminoadipic acid is elevated in prostate biopsy tissues from prostate cancer patients (PMID: 23737455).  Mutations in DHTKD1 (dehydrogenase E1 and transketolase domain-containing protein 1) have been shown to cause human 2-aminoadipic and 2-oxoadipic aciduria via impaired turnover of decarboxylation 2-oxoadipate to glutaryl-CoA, which is the last step in the lysine degradation pathway (PMID: 23141293).  Aging, diabetes, sepsis and renal failure are known to catalyze the oxidation of lysyl residues to 2-aminoadipic acid in human skin collagen and potentially other tissues (PMID: 18448817).  Proteolytic breakdown of these tissues can lead to the release of free 2-aminoadipic acid.  Studies in rats indicate that aminoadipic acid (along with the 3 branched chain amino acid  Leu, Val and Ile) levels are elevated in the pre-diabetic phase and so aminoadipic acid may serve as a predictive biomarker for the development of diabetes. (PMID: 15389298). Long-term hyperglycemia of endothelial cells leads to elevated levels of aminoadipate which is though to be a sign of lysine breakdown through oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (PMID: 21961526).  2-aminoadipate is a potential small-molecule marker of oxidative stress (PMID: 21647514)	C6H11NO4		None	None	None	15.954	14.879	15.233	15.586	14.902	14.794	14.775	15.203	15.344	13.972	14.403	15.667	15.288	14.614	16.224	15.656	14.24	14.896	14.273	14.812	15.049	14.401	15.229	15.076	14.388	14.247	14.614	15.638	15.9	15.59	15.073	14.117	14.282	15.229	15.008	14.519	15.0	14.395	14.782

163.0389740_MZ	Phenylpyruvic acid	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Phenylpyruvic acid is a keto-acid that is an intermediate or catabolic byproduct of phenylalanine metabolism. It has a slight honey-like odor. Levels of phenylpyruvate are normally very low in blood or urine. High levels of phenylpyruvic acid can be found in the urine of individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU). PKU is due to lack of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), so that phenylalanine is converted not to tyrosine but to phenylpyruvic acid. In particular, excessive phenylalanine can be metabolized into phenylketones through, a transaminase pathway route involving glutamate. Metabolites of this transamination reaction include phenylacetate, phenylpyruvate and phenethylamine. In persons with PKU, dietary phenylalanine either accumulates in the body or some of it is converted to phenylpyruvic acid. Individuals with PKU tend to excrete large quantities of phenylpyruvate, phenylacetate and phenyllactate, along with phenylalanine, in their urine. If untreated, mental retardation effects and microcephaly are evident by the first year along with other symptoms which include: unusual irritability, epileptic seizures and skin lesions. Hyperactivity, EEG abnormalities and seizures, and severe learning disabilities are major clinical problems later in life. A musty or mousy odor of skin, hair, sweat and urine (due to phenylacetate accumulation); and a tendency to hypopigmentation and eczema are also observed. The neural-development effects of PKU are primarily due to the disruption of neurotransmitter synthesis. In particular, phenylalanine is a large, neutral amino acid which moves across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via the large neutral amino acid transporter (LNAAT). Excessive phenylalanine in the blood saturates the transporter. Thus, excessive levels of phenylalanine significantly decrease the levels of other LNAAs in the brain. But since these amino acids are required for protein and neurotransmitter synthesis, phenylalanine accumulation disrupts brain development, leading to mental retardation.

163.0611330_MZ	L-Fucose	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Fucose is a hexose deoxy sugar with the chemical formula C6H12O5. L-fucose (6-deoxy-L-galactose) is a monosaccharide that is a common component of many N- and O-linked glycans and glycolipids produced by mammalian cells. It is the fundamental sub-unit of the fucoidan polysaccharide. As a free sugar, L-fucose is normally found at very low levels in mammals. It is unique in that it is the only levorotatory sugar synthesized and utilized by mammals. Fucose polymers are synthesized by fucosyltransferases.  All fucosyltransferases utilize a nucleotide-activated form of fucose, GDP-fucose, as a fucose donor in the construction of fucosylated oligosaccharides. The ABO blood group antigens are among the most well known fucosylated glycans. The alpha-1->3 linked core fucose is a suspected carbohydrate antigen for IgE-mediated allergy. Two structural features distinguish fucose from other six-carbon sugars present in mammals: the lack of a hydroxyl group on the carbon at the 6-position (C-6) and the L-configuration. In fucose-containing glycan structures, fucosylated glycans, fucose can exist as a terminal modification or serve as an attachment point for adding other sugars. Fucose is metabolized by an enzyme called alpha-fucosidase. Fucose is secreted in urine when the liver is damaged.  Free L-fucose in serum and urine can be used as a marker for cancer, cirrhosis, alcoholic liver disease and gastric ulcers (PMID: 2311216) (PMID: 8488966). Elevated levels of serum fucose have been reported in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. It has been shown that feeding rats a diet high in L-fucose induces neuropathy similar to that seen in diabetics.

164.0715830_MZ	L-Phenylalanine	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Phenylalanine is an essential amino acid and the precursor for the amino acid tyrosine. Like tyrosine, it is the precursor of catecholamines in the body (tyramine, dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine). The psychotropic drugs (mescaline, morphine, codeine, and papaverine) also have phenylalanine as a constituent. Phenylalanine is a precursor of the neurotransmitters called catecholamines, which are adrenalin-like substances. Phenylalanine is highly concentrated in the human brain and plasma. Normal metabolism of phenylalanine requires biopterin, iron, niacin, vitamin B6, copper and vitamin C. An average adult ingests 5 g of phenylalanine per day and may optimally need up to 8 g daily. Phenylalanine is highly concentrated in high protein foods, such as meat, cottage cheese and wheat germ. A new dietary source of phenylalanine is artificial sweeteners containing aspartame. Aspartame appears to be nutritious except in hot beverages; however, it should be avoided by phenylketonurics and pregnant women. Phenylketonurics, who have a genetic error of phenylalanine metabolism, have elevated serum plasma levels of phenylalanine up to 400 times normal. Mild phenylketonuria can be an unsuspected cause of hyperactivity, learning problems, and other developmental problems in children. Phenylalanine can be an effective pain reliever. Its use in premenstrual syndrome and Parkinson's may enhance the effects of acupuncture and electric transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TENS). Phenylalanine and tyrosine, like L-dopa, produce a catecholamine effect. Phenylalanine is better absorbed than tyrosine and may cause fewer headaches. Low phenylalanine diets have been prescribed for certain cancers with mixed results. Some tumors use more phenylalanine (particularly melatonin-producing tumors called melanoma). One strategy is to exclude this amino acid from the diet, i.e., a Phenylketonuria (PKU) diet (compliance is a difficult issue; it is hard to quantify and is under-researched). The other strategy is just to increase phenylalanine's competing amino acids, i.e., tryptophan, valine, isoleucine and leucine, but not tyrosine. (http://www.dcnutrition.com).

Metabolism of PEP to pyruvate by pyruvate kinase (PK) generates 1 molecule of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via substrate-level phosphorylation. ATP is one of the major currencies of chemical energy within cells. In gluconeogenesis, PEP is formed from the decarboxylation of oxaloacetate and hydrolysis of 1 guanosine triphosphate molecule. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). This reaction is a rate-limiting step in gluconeogenesis. (wikipedia).

167.0209758_MZ	Uric acid	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Uric acid is a heterocyclic purine derivative that is the final oxidation product of purine metabolism. It is produced by the enzyme xanthine oxidase, which oxidizes oxypurines such as xanthine into uric acid. In most mammals, except humans and higher primates, the enzyme uricase further oxidizes uric acid to allantoin. Uric acid is also the end product of nitrogen metabolism in birds and reptiles. In such species, it is excreted in feces as a dry mass. Humans produce only small quantities of uric acid with excess accumulation leading to a type of arthritis known as gout. The loss of uricase in higher primates parallels the similar loss of the ability to synthesize ascorbic acid vitamin C. This may be because in higher primates uric acid partially replaces ascorbic acid.

170.0454569_MZ	Tetrahydrodipicolinate	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Tetrahydrodipicolinate, converted from L-aspartate, is an important intermediate in lysine biosynthesis pathway. Several pathways are now recognized in bacteria, most algae, fungi and higher plants for the biosynthesis of lysine. They are divided into two groups - the diaminopimelate (DAP) pathways, and the &#945;-aminoadipate (AAA) pathways. In the pathways that belong to the DAP group, lysine is produced from aspartate (along with methionine, threonine and isoleucine). All of these pathways share the upper segments, which include the four steps required for conversion of L-aspartate to tetrahydrodipicolinate. They also share the last step, which is the conversion of the intermediate meso-diaminopimelate (D,L-DAP, or meso-DAP) to lysine. However, these pathways differ in the routes leading from tetrahydrodipicolinate to meso-diaminopimelate. The four variations include: (I) the succinylase variant, which involves succinylated intermediates. In this route tetrahydrodipicolinate is coverted to meso-diaminopimelate in four enzymatic steps; (II) the acetylase variant, which involves acetylated intermediates. This route also involves four enzymatic steps for the conversion of tetrahydrodipicolinate to meso-diaminopimelate; (III) the dehydrogenase variant, in which tetrahydrodipicolinate is converted to meso-diaminopimelate in a single enzymatic step; (IV) the diaminopimelate-aminotransferase variant, in which tetrahydrodipicolinate is converted to meso-diaminopimelate in two steps. In addition to lysine, the pathways in this group also produce meso-DAP, which is an important metabolite on its own.

173.1042000_MZ	L-Arginine	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Arginine is an essential amino acid that is physiologically active in the L-form. In mammals, arginine is formally classified as a semiessential or conditionally essential amino acid, depending on the developmental stage and health status of the individual. Infants are unable to effectively synthesize arginine, making it nutritionally essential for infants. Adults, however, are able to synthesize arginine in the urea cycle. Arginine can be considered to be a basic amino acid as the part of the side chain nearest to the backbone is long, carbon-containing and hydrophobic, whereas the end of the side chain is a complex guanidinium group. With a pKa of 12.48, the guanidinium group is positively charged in neutral, acidic and even most basic environments. Because of the conjugation between the double bond and the nitrogen lone pairs, the positive charge is delocalized. This group is able to form multiple H-bonds. L-arginine is an amino acid that has numerous functions in the body. It helps dispose of ammonia, is used to make compounds such as nitric oxide, creatine, L-glutamate, L-proline, and it can be converted to glucose and glycogen if needed. In large doses, L-arginine also stimulates the release of hormones growth hormone and prolactin. Arginine is a known inducer of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and is responsible for inducing protein synthesis through the mTOR pathway. mTOR inhibition by rapamycin partially reduces arginine-induced protein synthesis PMID: 20841502. Catabolic disease states such as sepsis, injury, and cancer cause an increase in arginine utilization, which can exceed normal body production, leading to arginine depletion. Arginine also activates AMP kinase (AMPK) which then stimulates skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation and muscle glucose uptake, thereby increasing insulin secretion by pancreatic beta-cells. PMID: 21311355 Arginine is found in plant and animal proteins, such as dairy products, meat, poultry, fish, and nuts. The ratio of L-arginine to lysine is also important - soy and other plant proteins have more L-arginine than animal sources of protein.

178.0509898_MZ	Hippuric acid	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Hippuric acid is an acyl glycine formed by the conjugation of benzoic aicd with glycine. Acyl glycines are produced through the action of glycine N-acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.13) which is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction: acyl-CoA + glycine < -- > CoA + N-acylglycine. Hippuric acid is a normal component of urine and is typically increased with increased consumption of phenolic compounds (tea, wine, fruit juices). These phenols are converted to benzoic acid which is then converted to hippuric acid and excreted in the urine. Hippuric acid is the most frequently used biomarker in the biological monitoring of occupational exposure to toluene. This product of solvent biotransformation may be also found in the urine of individuals who have not been exposed to the solvent. A smaller fraction of the absorbed toluene is oxidized to aromatic compounds including ortho-cresol, which is not found significantly in the urine of nonexposed individuals. The concentration of hippuric acid in the urine of individuals exposed to a low toluene concentration does not differ from that of individuals not exposed to the solvent. This has led to the conclusion that hippuric acid should not be utilized in the biological monitoring of occupational exposure to low levels of toluene in the air. Protein-bound organic acids such as hippuric acid are markedly accumulated in uremic plasma and produce defective protein binding of drugs. (PMID: 9120876, 8734460).

178.0719700_MZ	Fructosamine	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Fructosamine is a compound which can be considered as the result of a reaction between fructose and ammonia or an amine (with a molecule of water being released). A fructosamine is also formed when carbonyl group of glucose reacts with an amino group of a protein, as the double bond to oxygen moves from the end carbon atom to the next carbon atom and water is released. Fructosamines formed from blood proteins such as serum albumin are known as Glycated Serum Protein (GSP) or Glycated Albumin, and are used to identify the plasma glucose concentration over time and so assess diabetic control. (wikipedia). Glucose molecules are joined to protein molecules to form stable ketoamines, or fructosamines, through glycation, a nonenzymatic mechanism involving a labile Schiff base intermediate and the Amadori rearrangement. The amount of fructosamine in serum is increased in diabetes mellitus owing to the abnormally high concentration of sugar in blood. The concentration of fructosamine in serum thus reflects the degree of glycemic control attained by the diabetic patient and is useful in monitoring the effectiveness of therapy in diabetes over a period of several weeks, in a manner analogous to the determination of glycated hemoglobin. Of the analytical approaches used to measure fructosamine, affinity chromatography with m-aminophenylboronic acid and the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction method appear to be the most practical means for clinical chemists to assay fructosamine quickly, economically, and accurately. Fructosamine values can readily distinguish normal individuals and diabetic patients in good glycemic control from diabetics in poor control. Unlike glycated hemoglobin, which reflects the average blood sugar concentration over the past six to eight weeks, fructosamine reflects the average blood sugar concentration over the past two to three weeks. Thus a clinical advantage is that fructosamine responds more quickly to changes in therapy, thereby allowing for improved glycemic control. Fructosamine is used in conjunction with determinations of blood sugar and (or) of glycated hemoglobin, or by itself, the fructosamine assay can provide clinically useful information for the detection and control of diabetes.

Salsolinol was detected in urine of parkinsonian patients administered with L-DOPA. This finding stimulated the studies on Salsolinol derivatives in the brain, and gave new aspects of the endogenous alkaloids, which had been considered to occur only in plants. In normal non-alcoholic subjects and alcoholics, Salsolinol and O-methylated Salsolinol were found in urine, cerebrospinal fluid and brains. Salsolinol has an asymmetric center at first position and exists as (R)- and (S)enantiomer. The (R)enantiomer of Salsolinol is predominant in urine from healthy volunteers. Only the (R)enantiomers of Salsolinol and N-methylated Salsolinol occur in the human brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and intraventricular fluid (IVF), and the (S)enantiomers were not detected. (R)salsolinol synthase catalyzes the enantio-selective synthesis of (R)Salsolinol and 1-carboxyl(R)Salsolinol from dopamine with acetaldehyde or pyruvic acid. The N-methylation of (R)salsolinol into N-methylsalsolinol (NMSal) is catalyzed by two N-methyltransferases with different optimum pH, at pH 7.0 and 8.4. NM(R)Salsolinol is enzymatically oxidized into 1,2-dimethyl-6,7-dihydroxyisoquinolinium ion (DMDHIQ+) by an oxidase sensitive to semicarbaside and also non-enzymatically by autoxidation. NM(R)Salsolinol and its precursor, dopamine, were found to occur selectively in the nigro-striatum, whereas (R)Salsolinol distributes uniformly among the brain regions. (PMID 14697894).

180.0666970_MZ	L-Tyrosine	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Tyrosine is an essential amino acid that readily passes the blood-brain barrier. Once in the brain, it is a precursor for the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine, better known as adrenalin. These neurotransmitters are an important part of the body's sympathetic nervous system, and their concentrations in the body and brain are directly dependent upon dietary tyrosine. Tyrosine is not found in large concentrations throughout the body, probably because it is rapidly metabolized. Folic acid, copper and vitamin C are cofactor nutrients of these reactions. Tyrosine is also the precursor for hormones, thyroid, catecholestrogens and the major human pigment, melanin. Tyrosine is an important amino acid in many proteins, peptides and even enkephalins, the body's natural pain reliever. Valine and other branched amino acids, and possibly tryptophan and phenylalanine may reduce tyrosine absorption. A number of genetic errors of tyrosine metabolism occur. Most common is the increased amount of tyrosine in the blood of premature infants, which is marked by decreased motor activity, lethargy and poor feeding. Infection and intellectual deficits may occur. Vitamin C supplements reverse the disease. Some adults also develop elevated tyrosine in their blood. This indicates a need for more vitamin C. More tyrosine is needed under stress, and tyrosine supplements prevent the stress-induced depletion of norepinephrine and can cure biochemical depression. However, tyrosine may not be good for psychosis. Many antipsychotic medications apparently function by inhibiting tyrosine metabolism. L-dopa, which is directly used in Parkinson's, is made from tyrosine. Tyrosine, the nutrient, can be used as an adjunct in the treatment of Parkinson's. Peripheral metabolism of tyrosine necessitates large doses of tyrosine, however, compared to L-dopa. (http://www.dcnutrition.com).

180.1035825_MZ	L-Carnitine	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Carnitine is not an essential amino acid; it can be synthesized in the body. However, it is so important in providing energy to muscles including the heart-that some researchers are now recommending carnitine supplements in the diet, particularly for people who do not consume much red meat, the main food source for carnitine. Carnitine has been described as a vitamin, an amino acid, or a metabimin, i.e., an essential metabolite. Like the B vitamins, carnitine contains nitrogen and is very soluble in water, and to some researchers carnitine is a vitamin (Liebovitz 1984). It was found that an animal (yellow mealworm) could not grow without carnitine in its diet. However, as it turned out, almost all other animals, including humans, do make their own carnitine; thus, it is no longer considered a vitamin. Nevertheless, in certain circumstances-such as deficiencies of methionine, lysine or vitamin C or kidney dialysis--carnitine shortages develop. Under these conditions, carnitine must be absorbed from food, and for this reason it is sometimes referred to as a metabimin or a conditionally essential metabolite. Like the other amino acids used or manufactured by the body, carnitine is an amine. But like choline, which is sometimes considered to be a B vitamin, carnitine is also an alcohol (specifically, a trimethylated carboxy-alcohol). Thus, carnitine is an unusual amino acid and has different functions than most other amino acids, which are most usually employed by the body in the construction of protein. Carnitine is an essential factor in fatty acid metabolism in mammals. It's most important known metabolic function is to transport fat into the mitochondria of muscle cells, including those in the heart, for oxidation. This is how the heart gets most of its energy. In humans, about 25% of carnitine is synthesized in the liver, kidney and brain from the amino acids lysine and methionine. Most of the carnitine in the body comes from dietary sources such as red meat and dairy products. Inborn errors of carnitine metabolism can lead to brain deterioration like that of Reye's syndrome, gradually worsening muscle weakness, Duchenne-like muscular dystrophy and extreme muscle weakness with fat accumulation in muscles. Borurn et al. (1979) describe carnitine as an essential nutrient for pre-term babies, certain types (non-ketotic) of hypoglycemics, kidney dialysis patients, cirrhosis, and in kwashiorkor, type IV hyperlipidemia, heart muscle disease (cardiomyopathy), and propionic or organic aciduria (acid urine resulting from genetic or other anomalies). In all these conditions and the inborn errors of carnitine metabolism, carnitine is essential to life and carnitine supplements are valuable. carnitine therapy may also be useful in a wide variety of clinical conditions. carnitine supplementation has improved some patients who have angina secondary to coronary artery disease. It may be worth a trial in any form of hyperlipidemia or muscle weakness. carnitine supplements may be useful in many forms of toxic or metabolic liver disease and in cases of heart muscle disease. Hearts undergoing severe arrhythmia quickly deplete their stores of carnitine. Athletes, particularly in Europe, have used carnitine supplements for improved endurance. carnitine may improve muscle building by improving fat utilization and may even be useful in treating obesity. carnitine joins a long list of nutrients which may be of value in treating pregnant women, hypothyroid individuals, and male infertility due to low motility of sperm. Even the Physician's Desk Reference gives indication for carnitine supplements as improving the tolerance of ischemic heart disease, myocardial insufficiencies, and type IV hyperlipoproteinemia. carnitine deficiency is noted in abnormal liver function, renal dialysis patients, and severe to moderate muscular weakness with associated anorexia.

Only the sulfur atom from methionine is transferred to cysteine; the carbon skeleton of cysteine is donated by serine. (PMID 16702340). The adequacy range of dietary requirements of specific amino acids in disease states is difficult to determine. Requirements may not be similar in disease with regard to protein synthesis. Requirements for this purpose can be assessed only when such a function can be measured and related to clinical outcome. There is apparent consensus concerning normal sulfur amino acid (SAA) requirements. WHO recommendations amount to 13 mg/kg per 24 h in healthy adults. This amount is roughly doubled in artificial nutrition regimens. In disease or after trauma, requirements may be altered for methionine, cysteine, and taurine. Although in specific cases of congenital enzyme deficiency, prematurity, or diminished liver function, hypermethionemia or hyperhomocysteinemia may occur, SAA supplementation can be considered safe in amounts exceeding 2-3 times the minimal recommended daily intake. Apart from some very specific indications (e.g., acetaminophen poisoning) the usefulness of SAA supplementation is not yet established.(PMID 16702341). Methionine is known to exacerbate psychopathological symptoms in schizophrenic patients, there is no evidence of similar effects in healthy subjects. The role of methionine as a precursor of homocysteine is the most notable cause for concern. A loading dose of methionine (0.1 g/kg) has been given, and the resultant acute increase in plasma homocysteine has been used as an index of the susceptibility to cardiovascular disease. Although this procedure results in vascular dysfunction, this is acute and unlikely to result in permanent damage. However, a 10-fold larger dose, given mistakenly, resulted in death. Longer-term studies in adults have indicated no adverse consequences of moderate fluctuations in dietary methionine intake, but intakes higher than 5 times normal resulted in elevated homocysteine levels. These effects of methionine on homocysteine and vascular function are moderated by supplements of vitamins B-6, B-12, C, and folic acid. In infants, methionine intakes of 2 to 5 times normal resulted in impaired growth and extremely high plasma methionine levels, but no adverse long-term consequences were observed. (PMID 16702346).

190.0887455_MZ	5-Methoxytryptophol	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	5-Methoxytryptophol is synthesized by the pineal gland. Daily rhythms in pineal methoxyindole metabolism have been described in rodents and humans (5-Methoxytryptophol levels are coincident with serotonin levels in rodents pineal) and 5-Methoxytryptophol at its highest during the daylight hours and fall markedly soon after the onset of darkness, coincident with increases in the levels of pineal melatonin and the activities of pineal serotonin-N-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.87, SNAT) and hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.4, HIOMT). The fact that the levels of 5-methoxytryptophol and melatonin vary in parallel suggests that the major factor generating the methoxyindole rhythms is not SNAT activity, but perhaps a change in the availability (for metabolism) of stored serotonin. When the onset of darkness is delayed by 12 hours, human 5-methoxytryptophol (and melatonin) rhythms usually require 3 or 4 days to adjust to the new lighting regimen. Environmental factors, other than light, that activate the sympathetic nervous system or cause epinephrine to be secreted from the adrenal medulla (e.g., the stress of immobilization; insulin-induced hypoglycemia) can override the inhibitory effects of light and accelerate melatonin synthesis. Rhythms in 5-methoxytryptophol (and melatonin) synthesis apparently persist among animals placed in environments of continuous darkness; the source of the cyclic signal (mediated by the pineal sympathetic nerves) has not yet been identified. Preliminary evidence suggests that levels of a peptide hormone, arginine vasotocin, in rat pineal and sera also exhibit daily rhythms and are increased by norepinephrine. The circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion is generated in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Sleep disruption, nightly restlessness, sundowning, and other circadian disturbances are frequently seen in Alzheimer's disease patients. Changes in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and pineal gland are thought to be the biological basis for these behavioral disturbances. (PMID 288858, 2245336).

The evaluation of plasma citric acid is scarcely used in the diagnosis of human diseases. On the contrary urinary citrate excretion is a common tool in the differential diagnosis of kidney stones, renal tubular acidosis and it plays also a role in bone diseases. The importance of hypocitraturia should be considered with regard to bone mass, urine crystallization and urolithiasis. (PMID 12957820) The secretory epithelial cells of the prostate gland of humans and other animals posses a unique citrate-related metabolic pathway regulated by testosterone and prolactin. This specialized hormone-regulated metabolic activity is responsible for the major prostate function of the production and secretion of extraordinarily high levels of citrate. The key regulatory enzymes directly associated with citrate production in the prostate cells are mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and mitochondrial aconitase. testosterone and prolactin are involved in the regulation of the corresponding genes associated with these enzymes. The regulatory regions of these genes contain the necessary response elements that confer the ability of both hormones to control gene transcription. Protein kinase c (PKC) is the signaling pathway for the prolactin regulation of the metabolic genes in prostate cells. testosterone and prolactin regulation of these metabolic genes (which are constitutively expressed in all mammalian cells) is specific for these citrate-producing cells. (PMID 12198595) Citric acid is found in citrus fruits, most concentrated in lemons and limes, where it can comprise as much as 8% of the dry weight of the fruit. Citric acid is a natural preservative and is also used to add an acidic (sour) taste to foods and soft drinks. The salts of citric acid (citrates) can be used as anticoagulants due to their calcium chelating ability. Intolerance to citric acid in the diet is known to exist. Little information is available as the condition appears to be rare, but like other types of food intolerance it is often described as a pseudo-allergic reaction.

The salts of glucuronic acid are known as glucuronates. Glucuronic acid is highly soluble in water. In humans, glucuronic acid is often linked to toxic or poisonous substances to allow for subsequent elimination, and to hormones to allow for easier transport. These linkages involve O-glycosidic bonds. The process is known as glucuronidation, and the resulting substances are known as glucuronides (or glucuronosides). Glucuronidation uses UDP-glucuronic acid (glucuronic acid linked via a glycosidic bond to uridine diphosphate) as an intermediate. UDP-glucuronic acid is formed in the liver of all animals.

193.0713540_MZ	Caffeine	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Caffeine is the most widely consumed psychostimulant drug in the world that mostly is consumed in the form of coffee. Whether caffeine and/or coffee consumption contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the single leading cause of death in the US, is unclear. The literature indicates a strong relationship between boiled, unfiltered coffee consumption and elevated cholesterol levels; however, there is a critical gap in the literature regarding the effects of coffee or caffeine consumption on fibrinogen or CRP, which is an independent predictor of CVD risk. Available studies are limited by small samples sizes, inclusion of only men (or few women) and unrepresented age or ethnic groups. There is a critical need for controlled laboratory and epidemiological studies that include fibrinogen and CRP markers of CVD risk before conclusions can be drawn regarding the health effects of caffeine and/or coffee in a normal, healthy population of men and women. (PMID: 16856769 ). The relationship between caffeine consumption and various illnesses such as cardiovascular disease and cancer remains equivocal. Prudence might dictate that pregnant women and chronically ill individuals exercise restraint in their use of caffeine, although research suggests relatively low or nonexistent levels of risk associated with moderate caffeine consumption. (PMID: 7844249). There is extensive evidence that caffeine at dietary doses increases blood pressure (BP). However, concern that the drug may contribute to cardiovascular disease appears to have been dampened by (1) the belief that habitual use leads to the development of tolerance, and (2) confusion regarding relevant epidemiologic findings. When considered comprehensively, findings from experimental and epidemiologic studies converge to show that BP remains reactive to the pressor effects of caffeine in the diet. Overall, the impact of dietary caffeine on population BP levels is likely to be modest, probably in the region of 4/2 mm Hg. At these levels, however, population studies of BP indicate that caffeine use could account for premature deaths in the region of 14% for coronary heart disease and 20% for stroke. (PMID: 14747639). Caffeine is a purine alkaloid that occurs naturally in coffee beans. At intake levels associated with coffee consumption, caffeine appears to exert most of its biological effects through the antagonism of the A1 and A2A subtypes of the adenosine receptor. Adenosine is an endogenous neuromodulator with mostly inhibitory effects, and adenosine antagonism by caffeine results in effects that are generally stimulatory. Some physiological effects associated with caffeine administration include central nervous system stimulation, acute elevation of blood pressure, increased metabolic rate, and diuresis. Caffeine is rapidly and almost completely absorbed in the stomach and small intestine and distributed to all tissues, including the brain. Caffeine metabolism occurs primarily in the liver, where the activity of the cytochrome P450 isoform CYP1A2 accounts for almost 95% of the primary metabolism of caffeine. CYP1A2-catalyzed 3-demethylation of caffeine results in the formation of 1,7-dimethylxanthine (paraxanthine). Paraxanthine may be demethylated by CYP1A2 to form 1-methylxanthine, which may be oxidized to 1-methyluric acid by xanthine oxidase. Paraxanthine may also be hydroxylated by CYP2A6 to form 1,7-dimethyluric acid, or acetylated by N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) to form 5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil, an unstable compound that may be deformylated nonenzymatically to form 5-acetylamino-6-amino-3-methyluracil. Caffeine concentrations in coffee beverages can be quite variable. A standard cup of coffee is often assumed to provide 100 mg of caffeine, but a recent analysis of 14 different specialty coffees purchased at coffee shops in the US found that the amount of caffeine in 8 oz (=240 ml) of brewed coffee ranged from 72 to 130 mg.Caffeine in espresso coffees ranged from 58 to 76 mg in a single shot. (PMID 16507475). Caffeine is a member of the methylxanthine family of drugs, and is the most widely consumed behaviourally active substance in the western world. A number of in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that caffeine modulates both innate and adaptive immune responses. For instance studies indicate that caffeine and its major metabolite paraxanthine suppress neutrophil and monocyte chemotaxis, and also suppress production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha from human blood. Caffeine has also been reported to suppress human lymphocyte function as indicated by reduced T-cell proliferation and impaired production of Th1 (interleukin [IL]-2 and interferon [IFN]-gamma), Th2 (IL-4, IL-5) and Th3 (IL-10) cytokines. Studies also indicate that caffeine suppresses antibody production. The evidence suggests that at least some of the immunomodulatory actions of caffeine are mediated via inhibition of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-phosphodiesterase (PDE), and consequential increase in intracellular cAMP concentrations. Overall, these studies indicate that caffeine, like other members of the methylxanthine family, is largely anti-inflammatory in nature, and based on the pharmacokinetics of caffeine, many of its immunomodulatory effects occur at concentrations that are relevant to normal human consumption.

195.9897093_MZ	Selenomethionine	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Selenomethionine is an amino acid containing selenium that cannot be synthesized by higher animals, but can be obtained from plant material. Selenomethionine is the major seleno-compound in cereal grains (wheat grain, maize and rice), soybeans and enriched yeast. Seleno-compounds present in plants may have a profound effect upon the health of animals and human subjects. It is now known that the total Se content cannot be used as an indication of its efficacy, but knowledge of individual selenocompounds is necessary to fully assess the significance. Thus, speciation of the seleno-compounds has moved to the forefront. Since animals and man are dependent upon plants for their nutritional requirements, this makes the types of seleno-compounds in plants even more critical. Se enters the food chain through incorporation into plant proteins, mostly as selenocysteine and selenomethionine at normal Se levels. There are two possible pathways for the catabolism of selenomethionine. One is the transsulfuration pathway via selenocystathionine to produce selenocysteine, which in turn is degraded to H2Se by the enzyme b-lyase. The other pathway is the transamination-decarboxylation pathway. It was estimated that 90% of methionine is metabolized through this pathway and thus could be also the major route for selenomethionine catabolism. (PMID: 14748935, Br J Nutr. 2004 Jan;91(1):11-28.).

Xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) is the enzymes responsible for the conversion of xanthine to uric acid. It requires the presence of the molybdenum cofactor for its proper functioning. XDH is reported to have additional functions, i.e., the conversion of pterin to isoxanthopterin, one of the steps the degradation pathway of 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). Isoxanthopterin is very low in some cases of hereditary xanthinuria (OMIM 278300) and molybdenum cofactor deficiency (OMIM 252150). (PMID: 8812740).

203.0824159_MZ	Tryptophan	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Tryptophan is an essential amino acid which is the precursor of serotonin. Serotonin is a brain neurotransmitter, platelet clotting factor and neurohormone found in organs throughout the body. Metabolism of tryptophan to serotonin requires nutrients such as vitamin B6, niacin and glutathione. Niacin is an important metabolite of tryptophan. High corn or other tryptophan-deficient diets can cause pellagra, which is a niacin-tryptophan deficiency disease with symptoms of dermatitis, diarrhea and dementia. Inborn errors of tryptophan metabolism exist where a tumor (carcinoid) makes excess serotonin. Hartnup's disease is a disease where tryptophan and other amino acids are not absorbed properly. Tryptophan supplements may be useful in each condition, in carcinoid replacing the over-metabolized nutrient and in Hartnup's supplementing a malabsorbed nutrient. Some disorders of excess tryptophan in the blood may contribute to mental retardation. Assessment of tryptophan deficiency is done through studying excretion of tryptophan metabolites in the urine or blood. Blood may be the most sensitive test because the amino acid tryptophan is transported in a unique way. Increased urination of tryptophan fragments correlates with increased tryptophan degradation, which occurs with oral contraception, depression, mental retardation, hypertension and anxiety states. The requirement for tryptophan and protein decreases with age. Adults' minimum daily requirement is 3 mg/kg/day or about 200 mg a day. This may be an underestimation, for there are 400 mg of tryptophan in just a cup of wheat germ. A cup of low fat cottage cheese contains 300 mg of tryptophan and chicken and turkey contain up to 600 mg per pound. (http://www.dcnutrition.com).

205.0353814_MZ	(R)-lipoic acid	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Lipoic acid is a vitamin-like antioxidant that acts as a free-radical scavenger. Alpha-lipoic acid is also known as thioctic acid. It is a naturally occurring compound that is synthesized by both plants and animals. Lipoic acid contains two thiol groups which may be either oxidized or reduced. The reduced form is known as dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA). Lipoic acid (Delta E= -0.288) is therefore capable of thiol-disulfide exchange, giving it antioxidant activity. Lipoate is a critical cofactor for aerobic metabolism, participating in the transfer of acyl or methylamine groups via the 2-Oxoacid dehydrogenase (2-OADH) or alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to succinyl CoA. This activity results in the catabolism of the branched chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine). Lipoic acid also participates in the glycine cleavage system(GCV). The glycine cleavage system is a multi-enzyme complex that catalyzes the oxidation of glycine to form 5,10 methylene tetrahydrofolate, an important cofactor in nucleic acid synthesis. Since Lipoic acid is an essential cofactor for many enzyme complexes, it is essential for aerobic life as we know it. This system is used by many organisms and plays a crucial role in the photosynthetic carbon cycle. Lipoic acid was first postulated to be an effective antioxidant when it was found it prevented vitamin C and vitamin E deficiency. It is able to scavenge reactive oxygen species and reduce other metabolites, such as glutathione or vitamins, maintaining a healthy cellular redox state. Lipoic acid has been shown in cell culture experiments to increase cellular uptake of glucose by recruiting the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the cell membrane, suggesting its use in diabetes. Studies of rat aging have suggested that the use of L-carnitine and lipoic acid results in improved memory performance and delayed structural mitochondrial decay. As a result, it may be helpful for people with Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease. -- Wikipedia.

It is used for relief of symptoms of arthritis, primary dysmenorrhoea, and fever; Ibuprofen is an NSAID which is believed to work through inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), thus inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. There are at least 2 variations of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2), ibuprofen inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2. It appears that its analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory activity are achieved principally through COX-2 inhibition; whereas COX-1 inhibition is responsible for its unwanted effects on platelet aggregation and the GI mucosa. As with other NSAIDs, ibuprofen inhibits platelet aggregation, but is not used therapeutically for this action since it is a minor and reversible effect. -- Wikipedia.

It is a component of histone proteins, a precursor of carnitine and a coenzyme of fatty acid oxidation. N6,N6,N6-Trimethyl-L-lysine residues are found in a number of proteins and are generated by the action of S-adenosyl-L-methionine on exposed lysine residues. When trimethyllysine is released from cognate proteins via proteolysis, it serves as a precursor for carnitine biosynthesis. Mitochondrial 6-N-trimethyllysine dioxygenase converts 6-N-trimethyllysine to 3-hydroxy-6-N-trimethyllysine as the first step for carnitine biosynthesis. Because the subsequent carnitine biosynthesis enzymes are cytosolic, 3-hydroxy-6-N-trimethyllysine must be transported out of the mitochondria by a putative mitochondrial 6-N-trimethyllysine/3-hydroxy-6-N-trimethyllysine transporter system. Plasma -N-trimethyllysine concentrations are significantly lower in systemic carnitine deficiency patients compared to normal individuals, but no significant difference in urinary -N-trimethyllysine excretion is seen between the two groups.

210.0283355_MZ	Phosphocreatine	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Phosphocreatine undergoes irreversible cyclization and dehydration to form creatinine at a fractional rate of 0.026 per day, thus forming approximately 2 g creatinine/day in an adult male. This is the amount of creatine that must be provided either from dietary sources or by endogenous synthesis to maintain the body pool of (creatine and) phosphocreatine. Creatine is an amino acid that plays a vital role as phosphocreatine in regenerating adenosine triphosphate in skeletal muscle to energize muscle contraction. Creatine is phosphorylated to phosphocreatine in muscle in a reaction that is catalyzed by the enzyme creatine kinase. This enzyme is in highest concentration in muscle and nerve. Oral administration increases muscle stores. During the past decade, creatine has assumed prominence as an ergogenic (and legal) aid for professional and elite athletes. Most (~ 95%) of the total body creatine-phosphocreatine pool is in muscle (more in skeletal muscle than in smooth muscle) and amounts to 120 g (or 925 mmol) in a 70 kg adult male. Approximately 60-67% of the content in resting muscle is in the phosphorylated form. This generates enough ATP at the myofibrillar apparatus to power about 4 seconds of muscle contraction in exercise. Phosphocreatine reacts with ADP to yield ATP and creatine; the reversible reaction is catalyzed by creatine kinase. phosphocreatine is the chief store of high-energy phosphates in muscle. Thus, this reaction, which permits the rephosphorylation of ADP to ATP, is the immediate source of energy in muscle contraction. During rest, metabolic processes regenerate phosphocreatine stores. In normal muscle, ATP that is broken down to ADP is immediately rephosphorylated to ATP. Thus, phosphocreatine serves as a reservoir of ATP-synthesizing potential. phosphocreatine is the only fuel available to precipitously regenerate ATP during episodes of rapid fluctuations in demand. The availability of phosphocreatine likely limits muscle performance during brief, high-power exercise, i.e., maximal exercise of short duration. With near maximal isometric contraction, the rate of utilization of phosphocreatine declines after 1-2 seconds of contraction, prior to the glycolysis peak at approximately 3 seconds.

Indoxyl sulfate is one of the well known substances of a group of protein-bound uremic retention solutes. Indoxyl sulfate increases the rate of progression of renal failure. In plasma, indoxyl sulfate is a protein-bound uremic solute that induces endothelial dysfunction by inhibiting endothelial proliferation and migration in vitro. Some studies suggest that indoxyl sulfate is also involved in oxidative stress. In hemodialyzed patients, serum levels of indoxyl sulfate are associated with levels of pentosidine, a marker of carbonyl and oxidative stress; in vitro, indoxyl sulfate increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in tubular cells, and increases NAD(P)H oxidase activity in endothelial cells.

216.0987188_MZ	N-a-Acetylcitrulline	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	N-a-Acetylcitrulline is an N-acetylated metabolite of citrulline that is part of the arginine biosynthetic pathway. Arginine biosynthesis is notable for its complexity and variability at the genetic level, and by its connection with several other pathways, such as pyrimidine and polyamine biosynthesis, and certain degradative pathways. The initial steps of the arginine biosynthetic pathways proceed via N-acetylated intermediates. The presumed reason for this is that the acetylation prevents the spontaneous cyclization of glutamate derivatives, which leads to proline biosynthesis. N-acetyl-L-ornithine can be transcarbamylated directly by the enzyme acetylornithine transcarbamylase, resulting in N-acetyl-L-citrulline. The enzyme acetylornithine deacetylase can accept N-acetyl-L-citrulline as a substrate, and can deacetylate it into citrulline. N-a-Acetylcitrulline is found in cases of deficiency of the urea cycle enzyme argininosuccinate synthase (EC 6.3.4.5) that leads to increased concentrations of citrulline and N-acetylcitrulline in the urine.

The compound was first isolated from wounded bean plants by American chemists James English Jr. and James Frederick Bonner and Dutch scientist Aire Jan Haagen-Smit in 1939. Traumatic acid is a potent wound healing agent in plants (wound hormone) that stimulates cell division near a trauma site to form a protective callus and to heal the damaged tissue. It may also act as a growth hormone, especially in inferior plants (e.g. algae). Traumatic acid is biosynthesized in plants by non-enzimatic oxidation of traumatin (12-oxo-trans-10-dodecanoic acid), another wound hormone. At normal conditions, traumatic acid is a solid, crystalized, water insoluble substance.

228.0834021_MZ	Ergothioneine	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Ergothioneine is a naturally occurring metabolite of histidine that has antioxidant properties. -- Pubchem. Ergothioneine is a product of plant origin that accumulates in animal tissues. Ergothioneine is biosynthesized exclusively by fungi and mycobacteria and is captured by plants through their roots. As an ingredient of human food, ET is distributed very unevenly. By far, the highest levels of Ergothioneine have been found in mushrooms (0.1-1 mg/g dried material). Ergothioneine is rapidly cleared from the circulation and then avidly retained with minimal metabolism: the whole-body half-life of ingested Ergothioneine in rats is 1 month. The content of Ergothioneine varies greatly among tissues and is strongly dependent on its dietary level. In addition to erythrocytes and bone marrow, high Ergothioneine levels have also been found in seminal fluid. The precise physiological role of ET has remained elusive since its discovery in 1909. It is known that Ergothioneine is a powerful scavenger of hydroxyl radicals and an inhibitor of iron or copper ion-dependent generation of hydroxyl radicals from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). A specific ergothioneine transporter has recently been identified (gene symbol SLC22A4 - PMID: 15795384). Ergothioneine appears to play a pivotal protective role in monocytes, because the occurrence of rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease has very recently been linked to variant ergothioneine transporter genes (PMID: 15795384). SLC22A4 is highly expressed in the kidney, where it is thought to aid in active secretion of organic cations, and may facilitate the active reabsorption of ergothioneine.

The only known protein containing hypusine is eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A) and a similar protein found in archaebacteria. In human, two isoforms of eIF-5A have been described: eIF-5A-1 and eIF-5A-2. They are coded by two different genes. This protein is involved in protein biosynthesis and promotes the formation of the first peptide bond. The region surrounding the hypusine residue is highly conserved among the eukaryotes and is essential to the function of eIF-5A. Thus, hypusine and eIF-5A appear to be vital for the viability and proliferation of eukaryotic cells.

236.0774460_MZ	Biopterin	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Biopterin concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with Parkinson's disease, in which the nigrostriatal dopamine neurons degenerate, are lower than those from age-matched older controls. In hereditary progressive dystonia/DOPA-responsive dystonia, which is a dopamine deficiency caused by mutations in GTP cyclohydrolase I without neuronal cell death (Segawa's disease), neopterin and biopterin in cerebrospinal fluid decrease in parallel owing to the decreased activity in GTP cyclohydrolase I. GTP cyclohydrolase I (EC 3.5.4.16) is an enzyme that is part of the folate and biopterin biosynthesis pathways. It is responsible for the hydrolysis of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to form 7,8-dihydroneopterin 3'-triphosphate. (Pteridines (1999), 10(1), 5-13.) Lowered levels of urinary biopterin concomitant with elevated serum phenylalanine concentration occur in a variant type of hyperphenylalaninemia caused by a deficiency of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), the obligatory cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase. The most frequent form of this cofactor deficiency is due to lack of 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) activity, the second enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway for BH4. (PMID 8178819) The hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylating system consists of 3 essential components, phenylalanine hydroxylase, dihydropteridine reductase, and the nonprotein coenzyme, tetrahydrobiopterin. The reductase and the pterin coenzyme are also essential components of the tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylating systems. There are 3 distinct forms of phenylketonuria or hyperphenylalaninemia, each caused by lack of 1 of these essential components. The variant forms of the disease that are caused by the lack of dihydropteridine reductase or tetrahydrobiopterin are characterized by severe neurol. deterioration, impaired functioning of tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases, and the resultant deficiency of tyrosine- and tryptophan-derived monoamine neurotransmitters in brain.

These are compounds containing a polyisoprene chain attached to a quinone at the second ring position. Ubiquione-1 has just 1 isoprene unit. Normally in humans it has 10. Ubiquinone-1 is an intermediate in the synthesis of Ubiquionone 10, which is also called Coenzyme Q (CoQ). CoQ is found in the membranes of endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes, lysosomes, vesicles and notably the inner membrane of the mitochondrion where it is an important part of the electron transport chain; there it passes reducing equivalents to acceptors such as Coenzyme Q : cytochrome c - oxidoreductase. CoQ is also essential in the formation of the apoptosome along with other adapter proteins. The loss of trophic factors activates pro-apoptotic enzymes, causing the breakdown of mitochondria. Because of its ability to transfer electrons and therefore act as an antioxidant, Coenzyme Q has become a valued dietary supplement. CoQ10 has been widely used for the treatment of heart disease (especially heart failure), gum diseases, and also breast cancer. The benzoquinone portion of Coenzyme Q10 is synthesized from amino acids, while the isoprene sidechain is synthesized from acetyl CoA through the mevalonate pathway. The mevalonate pathway is used for the first steps of cholesterol biosynthesis.

256.0946105_MZ	Glycerophosphocholine	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC) is a choline derivative and one of the two major forms of choline storage (along with phosphocholine) in the cytosol. Glycerophosphorylcholine is also one of the four major organic osmolytes in renal medullary cells, changing their intracellular osmolyte concentration in parallel with extracellular tonicity during cellular osmoadaptation. As an osmolyte, Glycerophosphorylcholine counteracts the effects of urea on enzymes and other macromolecules. Kidneys (especially medullar cells), which are exposed under normal physiological conditions to widely fluctuating extracellular solute concentrations, respond to hypertonic stress by accumulating the organic osmolytes glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC), betaine, myo-inositol, sorbitol and free amino acids. Increased intracellular contents of these osmolytes are achieved by a combination of increased uptake (myo-inositol and betaine) and synthesis (sorbitol, GPC), decreased degradation (GPC) and reduced osmolyte release. GPC is formed in the breakdown of phosphatidylcholine (PtC). This pathway is active in many body tissues, including mammary tissue.

A member of the N-terminal nucleophile class of amidotransferases, GFAT transfers the amino group from the L-glutamine amide to D-fructose 6-phosphate, producing glutamic acid and glucosamine 6-phosphate. As glucosamine inhibits endothelial nitric oxide synthesis it has important implications for impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation and vascular dysfunction in diabetes mellitus.

Many odd length long chain amino acids are derived from the consumption of dairy fats (milk and meat). Heptadecanoic acid constitutes 0.61% of milk fat and 0.83% of ruminant meat fat. The content of heptadecanoic acid in the subcutaneous adipose tissue of humans appears to be a good biological marker of long-term milk fat intake in free-living individuals in populations with high consumption of dairy products.

270.1835173_MZ	Dextromethorphan	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Dextromethorphan is an antitussive drug that is found in many over-the-counter cold and cough preparations, usually in the form of dextromethorphan hydrobromide. Dextromethorphan is a salt of the methyl ether dextrorotatory isomer of levorphanol, a narcotic analgesic. Dextromethorphan occurs as white crystals, is sparingly soluble in water, and freely soluble in alcohol. The drug is dextrorotatory in water (at 20 degrees Celsius, Sodium D-line) with a specific rotation of +27.6 degrees. Following oral administration, dextromethorphan is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, where it enters the bloodstream and crosses the blood-brain barrier. Dextromethorphan shows high affinity binding to several regions of the brain, including the medullary cough center. The first-pass through the hepatic portal vein results in some of the drug being metabolized into an active metabolite of dextromethorphan, dextrorphan, the 3-hydroxy derivative of dextromethorphan. The therapeutic activity of dextromethorphan is believed to be caused by both the drug and this metabolite. Dextromethorphan is predominantly metabolized by the liver, by various hepatic enzymes. Through various pathways, the drug undergoes (O-demethylation (which produces dextrorphan), N-demethylation, and partial conjugation with glucuronic acid and sulfate ions. The inactive metabolite (+)-3-hydroxy-N-methylmorphinan is formed as a product of DXM metabolism by these pathways. One well known metabolic catalyst involved is a specific cytochrome P450 enzyme known as 2D6, or CYP2D6. A significant portion of the population has a functional deficiency in this enzyme (and are known as poor CYP2D6 metabolizers). As CYP2D6 is the primary metabolic pathway in the inactivation of dextromethorphan, the duration of action and effects of dextromethorphan are significantly increased in such poor metabolizers. Deaths and hospitalizations have been reported in recreational use by poor CYP2D6 metabolizers. -- Wikipedia.

271.1726068_MZ	Estradiol	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Estradiol is the most potent form of mammalian estrogenic steroids. Estradiol is produced in the ovaries. The ovary requires both luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to produce sex steroids. LH stimulates the cells surrounding the follicle to produce progesterone and androgens. The androgens diffuse across the basement membrane to the granulosa cell layer, where, under the action of FSH, they are aromatized to estrogens, mainly estradiol. The ovary shows cyclical activity, unlike the testis that is maintained in a more or less constant state of activity. Hormone secretions vary according to the phase of the menstrual cycle. In the developing follicle LH receptors (LH-R) are only located on the thecal cells and FSH receptors (FSHR) on the granulosa cells. The dominant pre-ovulatory follicle develops LH-Rs on the granulosa cells prior to the LH surge. Thecal cells of the preovulatory follicle also develop the capacity to synthesize estradiol and this persists when the thecal cells become incorporated into the corpus luteum. After ovulation, the empty follicle is remodelled and plays an important role in the second half or luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. This phase is dominated by progesterone and, to a lesser extent, estradiol secretion by the corpus luteum. estradiol is also synthesized locally from cholesterol through testosterone in the hippocampus and acts rapidly to modulate neuronal synaptic plasticity. Localization of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) in spines in addition to nuclei of principal neurons implies that synaptic ERalpha is responsible for rapid modulation of synaptic plasticity by endogenous estradiol. estradiol is a potent endogenous antioxidant which suppresses hepatic fibrosis in animal models, and attenuates induction of redox sensitive transcription factors, hepatocyte apoptosis and hepatic stellate cells activation by inhibiting a generation of reactive oxygen species in primary cultures. This suggests that the greater progression of hepatic fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in men and postmenopausal women may be due, at least in part, to lower production of estradiol and a reduced response to the action of estradiol. estradiol has been reported to induce the production of interferon (INF)-gamma in lymphocytes, and augments an antigen-specific primary antibody response in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. IFN-gamma is a potent cytokine with immunomodulatory and antiproliferative properties. Therefore, female subjects, particularly before menopause, may produce antibodies against hepatitis B virus e antigen and hepatitis B virus surface antigen at a higher frequency than males with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. The estradiol-Dihydrotestosterone model of prostate cancer (PC) proposes that the first step in the development of most PC and breast cancer (BC) occurs when aromatase converts testosterone to estradiol.

275.0922980_MZ	Gamma Glutamylglutamic acid	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Gamma Glutamylglutamic acid is made of two glutamic acid molecules. Glutamic acid (Glu), also referred to as glutamate (the anion), is one of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids. It is not among the essential amino acids. Glutamate is a key molecule in cellular metabolism. In humans, dietary proteins are broken down by digestion into amino acids, which serves as metabolic fuel or other functional roles in the body. Glutamate is the most abundant fast excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian nervous system. At chemical synapses, glutamate is stored in vesicles. Nerve impulses trigger release of glutamate from the pre-synaptic cell. In the opposing post-synaptic cell, glutamate receptors, such as the NMDA receptor, bind glutamate and are activated. Because of its role in synaptic plasticity, it is believed that glutamic acid is involved in cognitive functions like learning and memory in the brain. Glutamate transporters are found in neuronal and glial membranes. They rapidly remove glutamate from the extracellular space. In brain injury or disease, they can work in reverse and excess glutamate can accumulate outside cells. This process causes calcium ions to enter cells via NMDA receptor channels, leading to neuronal damage and eventual cell death, and is called excitotoxicity. The mechanisms of cell death include: * Damage to mitochondria from excessively high intracellular Ca2+. * Glu/Ca2+-mediated promotion of transcription factors for pro-apoptotic genes, or downregulation of transcription factors for anti-apoptotic genes. Excitotoxicity due to glutamate occurs as part of the ischemic cascade and is associated with stroke and diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, lathyrism, and Alzheimer's disease. glutamic acid has been implicated in epileptic seizures. Microinjection of glutamic acid into neurons produces spontaneous depolarization around one second apart, and this firing pattern is similar to what is known as paroxysmal depolarizing shift in epileptic attacks. This change in the resting membrane potential at seizure foci could cause spontaneous opening of voltage activated calcium channels, leading to glutamic acid release and further depolarization.

275.1249174_MZ	Saccharopine	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Saccharopine is an intermediate in the degradation of lysine, formed by condensation of lysine and alpha-ketoglutarate. The saccharopine pathway is the main route for lysine degradation in mammal and its first two reactions are catalyzed by enzymatic activities known as lysine-oxoglutarate reductase (LOR) and saccharopine dehydrogenase (SDH), which reside on a single bifunctional polypeptide (EC EC 1.5.1.8, LOR/SDH). The reactions involved by saccharopine dehydrogenases have a very strict substrate specificity for L-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate and NADPH. LOR/SDH has been detected in a number of mammalian tissues, mainly in the liver and kidney, contributing not only to the general nitrogen balance in the organism but also to the controlled conversion of lysine into ketone bodies. A tetrameric form has also been observed in human liver and placenta. LOR activity has also been detected in brain mitochondria during embryonic development, and this opens the question of whether the degradation of lysine has any functional significance during brain development and puts a new focus on the nutritional requirements for lysine in gestation and infancy. Finally, LOR and/or SDH deficiencies seem to be involved in a human autosomic genetic disorder known as familial hyperlysinemia, which is characterized by serious defects in the functioning of the nervous system, and characterized by deficiency in lysine-ketoglutarate reductase, saccharopine dehydrogenase, and saccharopine oxidoreductase activities. Saccharopinuria (high amounts of saccharopine in the urine) and saccharopinemia (an excess of saccharopine in the blood) are conditions present in some inherited disorders of lysine degradation.

277.2169946_MZ	Alpha-Linolenic acid	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). It is a member of the group of essential fatty acids called omega-3 fatty acids. Alpha-linolenic acid, in particular, is not synthesized by mammals and therefore is an essential dietary requirement for all mammals. Certain nuts (English walnuts) and vegetable oils (canola, soybean, flaxseed/linseed, olive) are particularly rich in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). Omega-3 fatty acids get their name based on the location of one of their first double bond. In all omega-3 fatty acids, the first double bond is located between the third and fourth carbon atom counting from the methyl end of the fatty acid (n-3). Although humans and other mammals can synthesize saturated and some monounsaturated fatty acids from carbon groups in carbohydrates and proteins, they lack the enzymes necessary to insert a cis double bond at the n-6 or the n-3 position of a fatty acid. Omega-3 fatty acids like a-linolenic acid are important structural components of cell membranes. When incorporated into phospholipids, they affect cell membrane properties such as fluidity, flexibility, permeability and the activity of membrane bound enzymes. Omega-3 fatty acids can modulate the expression of a number of genes, including those involved with fatty acid metabolism and inflammation. Alpha linolenic acid and other omega 3 fatty acids may regulate gene expression by interacting with specific transcription factors, including peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) and liver X receptors (LXRs).

P-Cresol (the precursor of p-cresol sulfate (PCS) and p-cresol glucuronide (PCG)) is mainly generated as an end product of tyrosine biotransformation by anaerobic intestinal bacteria. During passage through the colonic mucosa and liver, sulfatation and glucuronidation generates p-Cresol sulfate (as the most preponderant metabolite) and p-Cresol glucuronide (at markedly lower concentrations) (PMID: 23826225). Cresols are known as methylphenols. Cresols are used to dissolve other chemicals, such as disinfectants and deodorizers. They are also used to make specific chemicals that kill insect pests. Cresol solutions are used as household cleaners and disinfectants such as Lysol. Cresol solutions can also be found in photographic developers. In the past, cresol solutions have been used as antiseptics in surgery, but they have been largely displaced in this role by less toxic compounds. Cresols are found in many foods and in wood and tobacco smoke, crude oil, coal tar, and in brown mixtures such as creosote, cresolene and cresylic acids, which are wood preservatives. Microbes in the soil and water produce cresols when they break down materials in the environment. Most exposures to cresols are at very low levels that are not harmful. When cresols are breathed, ingested, or applied to the skin at very high levels, they can be very harmful. Effects observed in people include irritation and burning of skin, eyes, mouth, and throat; abdominal pain and vomiting. Cresols are also a chemical component found in Sharpie Markers. P-cresol is a major component in pig odor.

293.0098705_MZ	D-Glucuronic acid 1-phosphate	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	D-Glucuronic acid 1-phosphate is an end product of the UDP-glucuronic acid pathway. Formation of free glucuronic acid from UDP-glucuronic acid can be considered as the first step in the synthesis of vitamin C, a pathway that occurs in most vertebrates, although not in guinea pigs and primates, including humans. Free glucuronic acid can also be converted to pentose phosphate intermediates via the 'pentose pathway'. The latter is interrupted in subjects with pentosuria, who have a deficiency in l-xylulose reductase (EC 1.1.1.10, an enzyme that belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family) and excrete abnormal amounts of l-xylulose. Some xenobiotics stimulate the formation of vitamin C in animals and enhance the excretion of l-xylulose in humans with pentosuria and have shown that aminopyrine, metyrapone and other xenobiotics cause an almost instantaneous increase in the conversion of UDP-glucuronic acid to glucuronic acid. It is usually stated that glucuronic acid formation from UDP-glucuronic acid is the result of two successive reactions comprising the hydrolysis of UDP-glucuronic acid to glucuronic acid 1-phosphate and UMP by nucleotide pyrophosphatase (E-NPP3, EC 3.6.1.9), followed by dephosphorylation of glucuronic acid 1-phosphate. Glucuronidation is responsible for conjugating potentially toxic lipophilic compounds with glucuronic acid, thereby producing molecules with greater aqueous solubility that is excreted more readily into urine and bile. The rate at which any compound may be glucuronidated depends on the concentration and activity of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferases as well as the concentration of the cofactor UDP-glucuronic acid. UDP-glucuronic acid is formed after oxidation of UDP-glucose by UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UGDH, EC 1.1.1.22) with NAD as the electron acceptor. UDP-glucuronic acid may then be either used as the glucuronic acid donor for xenobiotic conjugation reactions by UDPglucuronosyltransferases (GlcAT-P, EC 2.4.1.17), or degraded to D-glucuronic acid 1-phosphate after the phosphodiester bond is cleaved by E-NPP3. E-NPP3 is the same enzyme that further reduces D-Glucuronic acid 1-phosphate to free D-glucuronic acid. Decreases in UDP-glucuronic acid concentration may be due to reduced availability of UDP-glucose or decreased UGDH activity or to increased activities of GlcAT-P or E-NPP3. Exposure to volatile anesthetics reduces hepatic UDP-glucuronic acid concentrations, and alters the rate of conjugation of compounds such as acetaminophen, bilirubin, diethylstilbestrol, iopanoic acid and valproic acid in a non-sex-dependent fashion in experimental mice. The depletion of UDP-glucuronic acid by anesthetics is caused by altered activity of microsomal E-NPP3. (PMID: 2167093, 16689937, 1276).

303.0838623_MZ	N-Acetylaspartylglutamic acid	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	N-Acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) is a neuropeptide found in millimolar concentrations in brain that is localized to subpopulations of glutamatergic, cholinergic, GABAergic, and noradrenergic neuronal systems. NAAG is released upon depolarization by a Ca(2+)-dependent process and is an agonist at mGluR3 receptors and an antagonist at NMDA receptors. NAAG is catabolized to N-acetylaspartate and glutamate primarily by glutamate carboxypeptidase II, which is expressed on the extracellular surface of astrocytes. The levels of NAAG and the activity of carboxypeptidase II are altered in a regionally specific fashion in several neuropsychiatric disorders. (PMID 9361299). N-Acetylaspartylglutamic acid (NAAG) is a purported precursor of N-Acetylaspartic acid (NAA) and is present at about one-tenth of the concentration of NAA in the brain. NAAG has been reported to activate N-methyl- D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors in neurons. Previous immunohistochemical studies in the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS) have suggested that NAAG is exclusively localized to neurons. Recent evidence, however, indicates that NAAG might also be localized to nonneuronal cells within the CNS. Only traces of NAA and NAAG are detectable in other tissues. Some compounds can change levels of NAA and NAAG in the brain. For example, methylphenidante increases the levels of NAA and NAAG in the cerebral cortex; amphetamine also increases NAA concentration in a mature brain by 26%, raising the possibility that other neurochemical systems might be involved in the clinical effects of stimulants.

303.2325397_MZ	Arachidonic acid	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Arachidonic acid is a polyunsaturated, essential fatty acid. It is found in animal and human fat as well as in the liver, brain, and glandular organs, and is a constituent of animal phosphatides. It is formed by the synthesis from dietary linoleic acid. Arachidonic acid mediates inflammation and the functioning of several organs and systems either directly or upon its conversion into eicosanoids. Arachidonic acid in cell membrane phospholipids is the substrate for the synthesis of a range of biologically active compounds (eicosanoids) including prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes. These compounds can act as mediators in their own right and can also act as regulators of other processes, such as platelet aggregation, blood clotting, smooth muscle contraction, leukocyte chemotaxis, inflammatory cytokine production, and immune function. Arachidonic acid can be metabolized by cytochrome p450 (CYP450) enzymes to 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), their corresponding dihydroxyeicosa-trienoic acids (DHETs), and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE). The production of kidney CYP450 arachidonic acid metabolites is altered in diabetes, pregnancy, hepatorenal syndrome, and in various models of hypertension, and it is likely that changes in this system contribute to the abnormalities in renal function that are associated with many of these conditions. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) catalyzes the hydrolysis of the sn-2 position of membrane glycerophospholipids to liberate arachidonic acid (PMID: 12736897, 12736897, 12700820, 12570747, 12432908).

305.0448170_MZ	Luteolin	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Luteolin is a naturally occurring flavonoid. (PMID: 17168665). The flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds found as integral components of the human diet. They are universally present as constituents of flowering plants, particularly of food plants. The flavonoids are phenyl substituted chromones (benzopyran derivatives) consisting of a 15-carbon basic skeleton (C6-C3-C6), composed of a chroman (C6-C3) nucleus (the benzo ring A and the heterocyclic ring C), also shared by the tocopherols, with a phenyl (the aromatic ring B) substitution usually at the 2-position. Different substitutions can typically occur in the rings, A and B. Several plants and spices containing flavonoid derivatives have found application as disease preventive and therapeutic agents in traditional medicine in Asia for thousands of years. The selection of a particular food plant, plant tissue or herb for its potential health benefits appears to mirror its flavonoid composition. The much lower risk of colon, prostate and breast cancers in Asians, who consume more vegetables, fruits and tea than populations in the Western hemisphere do, raises the question of whether flavonoid components mediate the protective effects of diets rich in these foodstuffs by acting as natural chemopreventive and anticancer agents. An impressive body of information exists on the antitumoral action of plant flavonoids. In vitro work has concentrated on the direct and indirect actions of flavonoids on tumor cells, and has found a variety of anticancer effects such as cell growth and kinase activity inhibition, apoptosis induction, suppression of the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases and of tumor invasive behavior. Furthermore, some studies have reported the impairment of in vivo angiogenesis by dietary flavonoids. Experimental animal studies indicate that certain dietary flavonoids possess antitumoral activity. The hydroxylation pattern of the B ring of the flavones and flavonols, such as luteolin seems to critically influence their activities, especially the inhibition of protein kinase activity and antiproliferation. The different mechanisms underlying the potential anticancer action of plant flavonoids await further elucidation. Certain dietary flavonols and flavones targeting cell surface signal transduction enzymes, such as protein tyrosine and focal adhesion kinases, and the processes of angiogenesis appear to be promising candidates as anticancer agents. Further in vivo studies of these bioactive constituents is deemed necessary in order to develop flavonoid-based anticancer strategies. In view of the increasing interest in the association between dietary flavonoids and cancer initiation and progression, this important field is likely to witness expanded effort and to attract and stimulate further vigorous investigations.

306.0767338_MZ	Glutathione	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Glutathione is a compound synthesized from cysteine, perhaps the most important member of the body's toxic waste disposal team. Like cysteine, glutathione contains the crucial thiol (-SH) group that makes it an effective antioxidant. There are virtually no living organisms on this planet-animal or plant whose cells don't contain some glutathione. Scientists have speculated that glutathione was essential to the very development of life on earth. glutathione has many roles; in none does it act alone. It is a coenzyme in various enzymatic reactions. The most important of these are redox reactions, in which the thiol grouping on the cysteine portion of cell membranes protects against peroxidation; and conjugation reactions, in which glutathione (especially in the liver) binds with toxic chemicals in order to detoxify them. glutathione is also important in red and white blood cell formation and throughout the immune system. glutathione's clinical uses include the prevention of oxygen toxicity in hyperbaric oxygen therapy, treatment of lead and other heavy metal poisoning, lowering of the toxicity of chemotherapy and radiation in cancer treatments, and reversal of cataracts. (http://www.dcnutrition.com/AminoAcids/) glutathione participates in leukotriene synthesis and is a cofactor for the enzyme glutathione peroxidase. It is also important as a hydrophilic molecule that is added to lipophilic toxins and waste in the liver during biotransformation before they can become part of the bile. glutathione is also needed for the detoxification of methylglyoxal, a toxin produced as a by-product of metabolism. This detoxification reaction is carried out by the glyoxalase system. Glyoxalase I (EC 4.4.1.5) catalyzes the conversion of methylglyoxal and reduced glutathione to S-D-Lactoyl-glutathione. Glyoxalase II (EC 3.1.2.6) catalyzes the hydrolysis of S-D-Lactoyl-glutathione to glutathione and D-lactate. GSH is known as a substrate in both conjugation reactions and reduction reactions, catalyzed by glutathione S-transferase enzymes in cytosol, microsomes, and mitochondria. However, it is also capable of participating in non-enzymatic conjugation with some chemicals, as in the case of n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), the reactive cytochrome P450-reactive metabolite formed by acetaminophen, that becomes toxic when GSH is depleted by an overdose (of acetaminophen). glutathione in this capacity binds to NAPQI as a suicide substrate and in the process detoxifies it, taking the place of cellular protein thiol groups which would otherwise be covalently modified; when all GSH has been spent, NAPQI begins to react with the cellular proteins, killing the cells in the process. The preferred treatment for an overdose of this painkiller is the administration (usually in atomized form) of N-acetylcysteine, which is used by cells to replace spent GSSG and renew the usable GSH pool.

Androsterone is also can be metabolized from other adrenal androgens such as dehydroepiandrosterone, dihydrotestosterone or androstenedione, and is considered an inactive end product; however, it can be a physiological effector in its own right. Androsterone might be converted back to dihydrotestosterone. Humans (and other primates) are unique among mammals in having high levels of circulating androsterone glucuronide, a process that is the major role uridine-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.17, UGT) enzymes for glucuronidation of steroid metabolism in humans. Conjugation of androsterone is a pathway found in all vertebrates and is widely recognized that the liver is a major site of glucuronidation; however it is now clear that extrahepatic tissues are also involved in the conjugation of compounds to which these tissues are exposed. High levels of androsterone glucuronide found in the human prostate, breast cyst fluid and ovary follicular fluid suggest that glucuronidation of 5alpha-reduced C19 steroids occurs in these tissues as well. In doping control, the ratio of androsterone/etiocholanone provides valuable information that allows the assignment of a urine specimen to a particular person or the identification of urine samples with identical steroid profiles; this is particularly important to detect attempts of urine manipulation including urine alteration and substitution.

315.2533388_MZ	Monoacylglyceride(0:0/15:0/0:0)	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	MG(0:0/15:0/0:0) is a monoacylglyceride. A monoglyceride, more correctly known as a monoacylglycerol, is a glyceride consisting of one fatty acid chain covalently bonded to a glycerol molecule through an ester linkage. Monoacylglycerol can be broadly divided into two groups; 1-monoacylglycerols (or 3-monoacylglycerols) and 2-monoacylglycerols, depending on the position of the ester bond on the glycerol moiety. Normally the 1-/3-isomers are not distinguished from each other and are termed 'alpha-monoacylglycerols', while the 2-isomers are beta-monoacylglycerols. Monoacylglycerols are formed biochemically via release of a fatty acid from diacylglycerol by diacylglycerol lipase or hormone sensitive lipase. Monoacylglycerols are broken down by monoacylglycerol lipase. They tend to be minor components only of most plant and animal tissues, and indeed would not be expected to accumulate because their strong detergent properties would have a disruptive effect on membranes. 2-Monoacylglycerols are a major end product of the intestinal digestion of dietary fats in animals via the enzyme pancreatic lipase. They are taken up directly by the intestinal cells and converted to triacylglycerols via the monoacylglycerol pathway before being transported in lymph to the liver. Mono- and Diglycerides are commonly added to commercial food products in small quantities. They act as emulsifiers, helping to mix ingredients such as oil and water that would not otherwise blend well.

317.0580974_MZ	Melanin	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Dermal melanin is produced by melanocytes, which are found in the stratum basale of the epidermis. Although human beings generally possess a similar concentration of melanocytes in their skin, the melanocytes in some individuals and races more frequently or less frequently express the melanin-producing genes, thereby conferring a greater or lesser concentration of skin melanin. Some individual animals and humans have no or very little melanin in their bodies, which is a condition known as albinism. Higher eumelanin levels also can be a disadvantage, however, beyond a higher disposition toward vitamin D deficiency. Dark skin is a complicating factor in the laser removal of port-wine stains. Effective in treating fair skin, lasers generally are less successful in removing port-wine stains in Asians and people of African descent. Higher concentrations of melanin in darker-skinned individuals simply diffuse and absorb the laser radiation, inhibiting light absorption by the targeted tissue. Melanin similarly can complicate laser treatment of other dermatological conditions in people with darker skin. Under the microscope melanin is brown, non-refractile and finely granular with individual granules having a diameter of less than 800 nanometers. This differentiates melanin from common blood breakdown pigments which are larger, chunky and refractile and range in color from green to yellow or red-brown. In heavily pigmented lesions, dense aggregates of melanin can obscure histologic detail. A dilute solution of potassium permanganate is an effective melanin bleach. Pigments causing darkness in skin, hair, feathers, etc. They are irregular polymeric structures and are divided into three groups: allomelanins in the plant kingdom and eumelanins and phaeomelanins in the animal kingdom. Because melanin is an aggregate of smaller component molecules, there are a number of different types of melanin with differing proportions and bonding patterns of these component molecules. Both pheomelanin and eumelanin are found in human skin and hair, but eumelanin is the most abundant melanin in humans, as well as the form most likely to be deficient in albinism. Freckles and moles are formed where there is a localized concentration of melanin in the skin. They are highly associated with pale skin. Melanin is a biopolymer and a neuropeptide. In the early 1970s, John McGinness, Peter Corry, and Peter Proctor reported that melanin is a high-conductivity organic semiconductor (Science, vol 183, 853-855 (1974)). Studies revealed that melanin acted as a voltage-controlled solid-state threshold switch. Further, it emitting a flash of light electroluminescence when it switched.

Ubiquinone-2 is an intermediate in the synthesis of Ubiquionone 10. Ubiquionone is involved in cellular respiration. It is fat-soluble and is therefore mobile in cellular membranes; it plays a unique role in the electron transport chain (ETC). In the inner bacterial membrane, electrons from NADH and succinate pass through the ETC to the oxygen, which is then reduced to water. The transfer of electrons through ETC results in the pumping of H+ across the membrane creating a proton gradient across the membrane, which is used by ATP synthase (located on the membrane) to generate ATP.

Typically, THP (allopregnanolone) is released in the brain in response to stress, and quiets the neural system within 30 minutes of escalation. This steroid hormone has recently been found to be responsible for the extreme mood swings found in teenagers. In adults and pre-pubescent chlidren THP normally helps soothe the activity of brain cells by binding to GABA receptors that inhibit accelerating electrical activity. However, in pubescent teenagers THP actually becomes a GABA receptor antagonist.

322.0450008_MZ	Cytidine monophosphate	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Cytidine monophosphate, also known as 5'-cytidylic acid and abbreviated CMP, is a nucleotide. It is an ester of phosphoric acid with the nucleoside cytidine. CMP consists of the phosphate group, the pentose sugar ribose, and the nucleobase cytosine. Cytidine monophosphate (CMP) is derived from cytidine triphosphate (CTP) with subsequent loss of two phosphates. The synthesis of the pyrimidines CTP and UTP occurs in the cytoplasm and starts with the formation of carbamoyl phosphate from glutamine and CO2. Next, aspartate undergoes a condensation reaction with carbamoyl-phosphate to form orotic acid. In a subsequent cyclization reaction, the enzyme Aspartate carbamoyltransferase forms N-carbamoyl-aspartate which is converted into dihydroorotic acid by Dihydroorotase. The latter is converted to orotate by Dihydroorotate oxidase. Orotate is covalently linked with a phosphorylated ribosyl unit with Orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (aka PRPP transferase) catalyzing reaction, yielding orotidine monophosphate (OMP). Orotidine-5-phosphate is decarboxylated by Orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase to form uridine monophosphate (UMP). UMP is phosphorylated by two kinases to uridine triphosphate (UTP) via two sequential reactions with ATP. CTP is subsequently formed by amination of UTP by the catalytic activity of CTP synthetase. Cytosine monophosphate (CMP) and uridine monophosphate (UMP) have been prescribed for the treatment of neuromuscular affections in humans. Patients treated with CMP/UMP recover from altered neurological functions. Additionally, the administration of CMP/UMP appears to favour the entry of glucose in the muscle and CMP/UMP may be important in maintaining the level of hepatic glycogen constant during exercise.

323.1274791_MZ	DHAP(10:0)	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	DHAP(10:0) is the decanoyl derivative of Dihydroxyacetone phosphate. It is also known as an alkyl-DHAP. This compound is formed by decanoic acid reacting with DHAP. Alkyl-DHAPs are intermediates in the synthesis of ether phospholipids. The initial steps of ether phospholipid biosynthesis take place in peroxisomes. Alkyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase is the peroxisomal enzyme that actually introduces the ether linkage. Levels of Alkyl-DHAP have been found to be strongly reduced in human fibroblasts derived from Zellweger syndrome and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata patients. Four other enzymes are known to be involved in the metabolism of acyl-DHAP and alkyl-DHAP. These include: acyl-DHAP/alkyl-DHAP oxidoreductase, DHAP acyltransferase, alkyl-DHAP phosphohydrolase, and a dinitrofluorobenzene-insensitive acyl-DHAP acylhydrolase. Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) is a biochemical compound primarily involved in the glycolysis metabolic pathway. DHAP is also the product of the dehydrogenation of L-glycerol-3-phosphate which is part of the entry of glycerol (sourced from triglycerides) into the glycolytic pathway. Conversely, reduction of glycolysis-derived DHAP to L-glycerol-3-phosphate provides adipose cells with the activated glycerol backbone they require to synthesize new triglycerides. Both reactions are catalyzed by the enzyme glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase with NAD+/NADH as cofactor. DHAP may be referred to as glycerone phosphate in older texts.

Although humans are genetically deficient in producing Neu5Gc, small amounts are present in human cells and biofluids. Humans cannot synthesize Neu5Gc because the human gene CMAH is irreversibly mutated, though it is found in apes. This loss of the CMAH gene was estimated to have occurred two to three million years ago, just before the emergence of the genus Homo. A dietary origin of Neu5Gc was suggested by human volunteer studies. These trace amounts of Neu5Gc were determined to come from the consumption of animals in the human diet (i.e. red meats such as lamb, pork, and beef). Neu5Gc can also be found in dairy products, but to a lesser extent. Neu5Gc is not found in poultry and is found in only trace amounts in fish (Wikipedia).

324.2913362_MZ	N-Oleoylethanolamine	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	N-Oleoylethanolamine (NOE or OEA) is a N-acylethanolamine. N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) constitute a class of lipid compounds naturally present in both animal and plant membranes as constituents of the membrane-bound phospholipid, N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE). NAPE is composed of a third fatty acid moiety linked to the amino head group of the commonly occurring membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylethanolamine. NAEs are released from NAPE by phospholipase D-type hydrolases in response to a variety of stimuli. Transient NAE release and accumulation has been attributed a variety of biological activities, including neurotransmission, membrane protection, and immunomodulation in animals. N-oleoylethanolamine is an inhibitor of the sphingolipid signaling pathway, via specific ceramidase inhibition (ceramidase converts ceramide to sphingosine). N-oleoylethanolamine blocks the effects of TNF- and arachidonic acid on intracellular Ca concentration. (PMID: 12692337, 12056855, 12560208, 11997249). N-oleoyl ethanolamine is related to the endocannabinoid anandamide. Endocannabinoids signal through cannabinoid receptors (also stimulated by the active ingredient of cannabis) but although related in structure, synthesis and degradation to anandamide, NOE cannot be considered an endocannabinoid as it does not activate the cannabinoid receptors. Most of the reported responses to NOE can be attributed to activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha). Administration of NOE inhibits body weight gain in rats. In adipocytes and hepatocytes, NOE inhibits mitogenic and metabolic signaling by the insulin receptor and produces glucose intolerance. It also inhibits gastric emptying, which might act together with the sensory neuronal signals to achieve satiety. NOE is permanently elevated in diabetic obese patients. NOE also reduces visceral and inflammatory responses through a PPAR-alpha-activation independent mechanism (PMID: 17449181). NOE has been shown to be an antagonist of TRVP1 (the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 receptor). Overall, NOE has beneficial effects on health by inducing food intake control, lipid beta-oxidation, body weight loss and analgesic effects (PMID: 18704536).

It is a short-acting nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic of the imidazopyridine class that potentiates gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter, by binding to GABAA receptors at the same location as benzodiazepines. It works quickly (usually within 15 minutes) and has a short half-life (two to three hours). Zolpidem has not adequately demonstrated effectiveness in maintaining sleep (unless delivered in a controlled-release form); however, it is effective in initiating sleep. Some users take zolpidem recreationally for these side effects. However, it may be less common than benzodiazepine abuse. Zolpidem can become addictive if taken for extended periods of time, due to dependence on its ability to put one to sleep or to the euphoria it can sometimes produce.

329.2479124_MZ	Docosapentaenoic acid	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Docosapentaenoic acid (also known as clupanodonic acid) is an essential omega-3 fatty acid (EFA) which is prevalent in fish oils. Docosapentaenoic acid, commonly called DPA, is an intermediary between eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 &#969;-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 &#969;-3). Seal oil is a rich source. There are three functions of docosapentaenoic acid. The most important is as part of phospholipids in all animal cellular membranes: a deficiency of docosapentaenoic acid leads to faulty membranes being formed. A second is in the transport and oxidation of cholesterol: clupanodonic acid tends to lower plasma cholesterol. A third function is as a precursor of prostanoids which are only formed from docosapentaenoic acid. Deficiency of this in experimental animals causes lesions mainly attributable to faulty cellular membranes: sudden failure of growth, lesions of skin and kidney and connective tissue, erythrocyte fragility, impaired fertility, uncoupling of oxidation and phosphorylation. In man pure deficiency of docosapentaenoic acid has been studied particularly in persons fed intravenously. A relative deficiency (that is, a low ratio in the body of docosapentaenoic to long-chain saturated fatty acids and isomers of docosapentaenoate) is common on Western diets and plays an important part in the causation of atherosclerosis, coronary thrombosis, multiple sclerosis, the triopathy of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and certain forms of malignant disease. Various factors affect the dietary requirement of docosapentaenoic acid. (PMID: 6469703).

There are two distinct isozymes of prostaglandin H synthase (PGHS), the key enzyme in prostaglandin biosynthesis; PGHS-1 is generally considered to play a housekeeping role, whereas PGHS-2 has been linked to various pathological processes. Both PGHS isozymes have two catalytic activities; they are a cyclooxygenase activity that converts arachidonic acid (AA) to prostaglandin G2 (PGG2) and a peroxidase activity that catalyzes the transformation of PGG2 to prostaglandin H2. Oxygenase activity is completely abolished in aspirin-treated PGHS-1 (ASA-PGHS-1), whereas aspirin-treated PGHS-2 (ASA-PGHS-2) still catalyzes formation of 11(R)-HPETE.

Prostacyclin is a potent vasodilator and platelet inhibitor produced by vascular endothelium. Endogenous production of prostacyclin under physiologic conditions is extremely low, far below the capacity of vascular tissue to generate this substance in response to stimulation in vitro. This may reflect a low frequency or intensity of stimulation of prostacyclin production. PGI2 synthase (PGIS), a catalyst of PGI2 formation from prostaglandin H2, is widely distributed and predominantly found in vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. PGI2 plays an important cardioprotective role increasingly appreciated in recent years in light of adverse effects of COX-2 inhibitors in clinical trials. This cardioprotection is thought to be mediated, in part, by prostacyclin inhibition of platelet aggregation. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that prostacyclin additionally protects from cardiovascular disease by pleiotropic effects on vascular smooth muscle. PGI2 inhibits proliferation of cultured vascular SMCs by inhibiting cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase.

The eicosanoids consist of the prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes (TXs), leukotrienes (LTs) and lipoxins (LXs). The PGs and TXs are collectively identified as prostanoids. Prostaglandins were originally shown to be synthesized in the prostate gland, thromboxanes from platelets (thrombocytes) and leukotrienes from leukocytes, hence the derivation of their names. All mammalian cells except erythrocytes synthesize eicosanoids. These molecules are extremely potent, able to cause profound physiological effects at very dilute concentrations. All eicosanoids function locally at the site of synthesis, through receptor-mediated G-protein linked signaling pathways.

343.1933046_MZ	11-Dehydrocorticosterone	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	11-Dehydrocorticosterone is a mineral corticosteroid. The conversion of inactive 11-ketoglucocorticoids such as 11-dehydrocorticosterone) into active 11b-hydroxyglucocorticoids (such as corticosterone) is catalyzed by 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11b-HSD1, EC 1.1.1.146), which is expressed in many tissues and plays an important role in metabolically relevant tissues such as the liver, adipose tissue, skeletal muscles and possibly kidney. Chronically elevated local glucocorticoid action as a result of increased 11beta-HSD1 activity rather than elevated systemic glucocorticoid levels has been associated with metabolic syndrome, which is characterized by obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular complications. Recent studies indicate that compounds inhibiting 11beta-HSD1 activity ameliorate the adverse effects of excessive glucocorticoid concentrations on metabolic processes, providing promising opportunities for the development of therapeutic interventions. 11-dehydrocorticosterone and corticosterone display antinatriuretic activity, although 11-dehydrocorticosterone is generally a more potent sodium retainer than corticosterone.

It is an ester of phosphoric acid with the nucleoside adenosine. AMP consists of the phosphate group, the pentose sugar ribose, and the nucleobase adenine. AMP can be produced during ATP synthesis by the enzyme adenylate kinase. AMP has recently been approved as a 'Bitter Blocker' additive to foodstuffs. When AMP is added to bitter foods or foods with a bitter aftertaste it makes them seem 'sweeter'. This potentially makes lower calorie food products more palatable.

A monoglyceride, more correctly known as a monoacylglycerol, is a glyceride consisting of one fatty acid chain covalently bonded to a glycerol molecule through an ester linkage. Monoacylglycerol can be broadly divided into two groups; 1-monoacylglycerols (or 3-monoacylglycerols) and 2-monoacylglycerols, depending on the position of the ester bond on the glycerol moiety. Normally the 1-/3-isomers are not distinguished from each other and are termed 'alpha-monoacylglycerols', while the 2-isomers are beta-monoacylglycerols. Monoacylglycerols are formed biochemically via release of a fatty acid from diacylglycerol by diacylglycerol lipase or hormone sensitive lipase. Monoacylglycerols are broken down by monoacylglycerol lipase. They tend to be minor components only of most plant and animal tissues, and indeed would not be expected to accumulate because their strong detergent properties would have a disruptive effect on membranes. 2-Monoacylglycerols are a major end product of the intestinal digestion of dietary fats in animals via the enzyme pancreatic lipase. They are taken up directly by the intestinal cells and converted to triacylglycerols via the monoacylglycerol pathway before being transported in lymph to the liver. Mono- and Diglycerides are commonly added to commercial food products in small quantities.

Plasma 11beta-Hydroxyprogesterone concentrations does not vary significantly as a function of age, sex, or phase of the menstrual cycle, in contrast to 17-hydroxyprogesterone. Increased plasma 11beta-Hydroxyprogesterone levels in late-onset adrenal 21-hydroxylase deficiency suggest a mild defect of the mineralocorticoid pathway. 21-hydroxylase deficiency (OMIM 201910) is probably the most frequent (if not the most frequent) autosomal recessive genetic disease, occurring in almost 1% of Caucasians and about 3% of Ashkenazi Jews. 21-hydroxylase deficiency is unusual among genetic diseases in that approximately 95% of the mutant alleles have apparently been generated by recombination between a normally active gene (CYP21) and a closely linked pseudogene (CYP21P). There are 4 recognized clinical forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, the majority of cases being associated with 21-hydroxylase deficiency: salt-wasting (SW), simple virilizing (SV), nonclassic (NC) late-onset (also called attenuated and acquired), and cryptic. (PMID: 3546944, 2537337). 11beta-hydroxyprogesterone acts as a mineralocorticoid agonist in stimulating Na+ absorption in mammalian principal cortical collecting duct cells.It activates the transiently expressed hMR in COS-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner (ED(50): 10(-8) M) and, like aldosterone, stimulated Ams I(sc) in mpkCCD(cl4) cells. Docking 11OHP within the hMR-ligand-binding domain homology model revealed that the agonist activity of 11OHP is caused by contacts between its 11 beta-hydroxyl group and Asn770. Furthermore, 11OHP was unable to activate the mutant hMR/N770A, in which Ala is substituted for Asn at position 770. These findings demonstrate that in the absence of the 21-hydroxyl group, the 11 beta-hydroxyl group can produce the contact with the hMR-Asn770 required for the hMR activation leading to stimulated Na(+) absorption.

They derive from C-20 polyunsaturated fatty acids, mainly dihomo-gamma-linoleic (20:3n-6), arachidonic (20:4n-6), and eicosapentaenoic (20:5n-3) acids, through the action of cyclooxygenases-1 and -2 (COX-1 and COX-2). The reaction product of COX is the unstable endoperoxide prostaglandin H (PGH) that is further transformed into the individual prostanoids by a series of specific prostanoid synthases. Prostanoids are local-acting mediators formed and inactivated within the same or neighbouring cells prior to their release into circulation as inactive metabolites (15-keto- and 13,14-dihydroketo metabolites). Non-enzymatic peroxidation of arachidonic acid and other fatty acids in vivo can result in prostaglandin-like substances isomeric to the COX-derived prostaglandins that are termed isoprostanes. Prostanoids take part in many physiological and pathophysiological processes in practically every organ, tissue and cell, including the vascular, renal, gastrointestinal and reproductive systems. Their activities are mediated through prostanoid-specific receptors and intracellular signalling pathways, whilst their biosynthesis and action are blocked by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID). Isoprostanes are considered to be reliable markers of oxidant stress status and have been linked to inflammation, ischaemia-reperfusion, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, reproductive disorders and diabetes.

361.3106681_MZ	Monoacylglyceride Phosphate with formula C21H42O3	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	1-(1Z-octadecenyl)-sn-glycerol is an ether lipid. Ether lipids are lipids in which one or more of the carbon atoms on glycerol is bonded to an alkyl chain via an ether linkage, as opposed to the usual ester linkage. Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids. In animal tissues, the alkyl and alkenyl moieties in both non-polar and phospholipids tend to be rather simple in composition with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 (double bond in position 9) predominating. Ether analogues of triacylglycerols, i.e. 1-alkyldiacyl-sn-glycerols, are present at trace levels only if at all in most animal tissues, but they can be major components of some marine lipids.

Neutrophil microsomes are known to oxidize 20-hydroxy-LTB4 (20-OH-LTB4) to its 20-oxo and 20-carboxy derivatives in the presence of NADPH. This activity has been ascribed to LTB4 omega-hydroxylase (cytochrome P-450LTB omega). Leukotriene B4 release from polymorphonuclear granulocytes of severely burned patients was reduced as compared to healthy donor cells. This decrease is due to an enhanced conversion of LTB4 into the 20-hydroxy- and 20-carboxy-metabolites and further to a decreased LTB4-synthesis. LTB4 is the major metabolite in neutrophil polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Leukotrienes are metabolites of arachidonic acid derived from the action of 5-LO (5-lipoxygenase). The immediate product of 5-LO is LTA4 (leukotriene A4), which is enzymatically converted into either LTB4 (leukotriene B4) by LTA4 hydrolase or LTC4 (leukotriene C4) by LTC4 synthase. The regulation of leukotriene production occurs at various levels, including expression of 5-LO, translocation of 5-LO to the perinuclear region and phosphorylation to either enhance or inhibit the activity of 5-LO. Biologically active LTB4 is metabolized by w-oxidation carried out by specific cytochrome P450s (CYP4F) followed by beta-oxidation from the w-carboxy position and after CoA ester formation. Other specific pathways of leukotriene metabolism include the 12-hydroxydehydrogenase/ 15-oxo-prostaglandin-13-reductase that form a series of conjugated diene metabolites that have been observed to be excreted into human urine. Metabolism of LTC4 occurs by sequential peptide cleavage reactions involving a gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase that forms LTD4 (leukotriene D4) and a membrane-bound dipeptidase that converts LTD4 into LTE4 (leukotriene E4) before w-oxidation. These metabolic transformations of the primary leukotrienes are critical for termination of their biological activity, and defects in expression of participating enzymes may be involved in specific genetic disease.

Research shows that there is negative relationship between nervonic acid and obesity-related risk factors (PMID: 16394593). Demyelination in adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is associated with an accumulation of very long chain saturated fatty acids stemming from a genetic defect in the peroxisomal beta oxidation system responsible for the chain shortening of these fatty acids.

Both 19-Hydroxy-PGE1 and 19-hydroxy-PGE2 are formed from PGE1 and PGE2 by prostaglandin 19-hydroxylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme, in seminal vesicles (PMID: 3196735). 19-Hydroxy-PGE2 is a selective prostanoid EP2-receptor agonist; it doesn't stimulate FP-receptors, and is devoid of activity on thromboxane A2, prostaglandin D2 and prostacyclin sensitive receptors. 19-OH PGE2 is formed in large quantities from PGE2 in human seminal plasma. PGE2 is the most common and most biologically active of the mammalian prostaglandins. It has important effects in labour and also stimulates osteoblasts to release factors which stimulate bone resorption by osteoclasts (a type of bone cell that removes bone tissue by removing the bone's mineralized matrix). (PMID: 16978535, 8248550, 817207). Dinoprostone is a naturally occurring prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and the most common and most biologically active of the mammalian prostaglandins. It has important effects in labour and also stimulates osteoblasts to release factors which stimulate bone resorption by osteoclasts (a type of bone cell that removes bone tissue by removing the bone's mineralized matrix). PGE2 has been shown to increase vasodilation and cAMP production, to enhance the effects of bradykinin and histamine, to induce uterine contractions and to activate platelet aggregation. PGE2 is also responsible for maintaining the open passageway of the fetal ductus arteriosus; decreasing T-cell proliferation and lymphocyte migration and activating the secretion of IL-1alpha and IL-2. PGE2 exhibits both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects, particularly on dendritic cells (DC). Depending on the nature of maturation signals, PGE2 has different and sometimes opposite effects on DC biology. PGE2 exerts an inhibitory action, reducing the maturation of DC and their ability to present antigen. PGE2 has also been shown to stimulate DC and promote IL-12 production when given in combination with TNF-alpha. PGE2 is an environmentally bioactive substance. Its action is prolonged and sustained by other factors especially IL-10. It modulates the activities of professional DC by acting on their differentiation, maturation and their ability to secrete cytokines. PGE2 is a potent inducer of IL-10 in bone marrow-derived DC (BM-DC), and PGE2-induced IL-10 is a key regulator of the BM-DC pro-inflammatory phenotype. (PMID: 16978535)Prostaglandins are eicosanoids.

Because anthocyanins impart much of the color and flavor of fruits and vegetables, they are usually components of the human diet and are not only considered exclusively as food products but also as therapeutic agents; in fact, anthocyanins have been suggested to protect against oxidative stress, coronary heart diseases, certain cancers, and other age-related diseases. At least part of these presumed health-promoting features can be attributed to the antioxidant properties of these compounds whose chemical structure appears ideal for free radical scavenging.

Distribution of 24:6n-3 in marine organisms was investigated by several researchers. Takagi et al. reported relatively high contents of 24:6n-3 in sea lilies and brittle stars (4&#8211;10% of total fatty acids). High 24:6n-3 content was also found in marine coelenterates. In some edible fishes, 24:6n-3 was detected at significant levels (0&#8211;10% of total fatty acids).The existence of 24:6n-3 in mammalian tissues was reported with other very long chain fatty acids in the spermatozoa,the retina, and the brain.

As functions to be studied, anti-inflammatory and antiallergic. effects of 24:6n-3 are noteworthy because these events are known to be closely related to the unsaturated fatty acid metabolism such as in the arachidonic acid cascade, and 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 were reported to suppress inflammatory actions by influencing arachidonic acid metabolism.s24:6n-3 could inhibit the antigen-stimulated production of LT-related compounds as well as other n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as eicosapentaenoic. acid (20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3), which are major n-3 PUFA in fish oils; 24:6n-3 was also shown to reduce the histamine content in MC/9 cells at 25 uM (27% reduction from the control), and the effect was diminished with increase of the fatty acid concentration (up to 100 uM). These two n-3 PUFA, 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3, also reduced the histamine content (16 and 20% reduction at 25 &#956;M, respectively), whereas arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) increased it (18% increase at 25 &#956;M).

375.2191795_MZ	Resolvin D2	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Resolvin D2 is an autacoid resolvin. Autacoids are chemical mediators including the families of resolvins and protectins, defined by their potent bioactions and novel chemical structures. The bioactive local mediators, or autacoids, that require enzymatic generation from the omega-3 essential fatty acid EPA were first identified in resolving inflammatory exudates in vivo and carry potent stereoselective biological actions. Resolvins of the E (RvE) series are derived from eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Those derived from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were termed resolvins of the D series, for example resolvin D1 (RvD1).Resolvins and protectins have specific stereoselective actions which evoke biological actions in the nanogram range in vivo and are natural exudate products. Resolvins and protectins as distinct chemical families join the lipoxins as potent agonists of endogenous anti-inflammation and are proresolving chemical mediators of interest in human disease as potential new approaches to treatment. The term resolvins (resolution-phase interaction products) was first introduced to signify that these new structures were endogenous mediators, biosynthesized in the resolution phase of inflammatory exudates, possessing very potent anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory actions. These actions include reducing neutrophil traffic, regulating cytokine and reactive oxygen species, and lowering the magnitude of the response. In recent years, investigators have recognized inflammation as playing a key role in many prevalent diseases not previously considered to be of inflammatory etiology. These include Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, which now join those well-appreciated inflammatory disorders such as arthritis and periodontal disease. Identifying the molecular mechanism(s) that underlie the many reports of the benefits of dietary omega-3 PUFAs remains an important challenge for nutrition and medicine.

A bile acid. Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in bile of mammals. The distinction between different bile acids is minute, depends only on presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g., membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues.

A monoglyceride, more correctly known as a monoacylglycerol, is a glyceride consisting of one fatty acid chain covalently bonded to a glycerol molecule through an ester linkage. Monoacylglycerol can be broadly divided into two groups; 1-monoacylglycerols (or 3-monoacylglycerols) and 2-monoacylglycerols, depending on the position of the ester bond on the glycerol moiety. Normally the 1-/3-isomers are not distinguished from each other and are termed 'alpha-monoacylglycerols', while the 2-isomers are beta-monoacylglycerols. Monoacylglycerols are formed biochemically via release of a fatty acid from diacylglycerol by diacylglycerol lipase or hormone sensitive lipase. Monoacylglycerols are broken down by monoacylglycerol lipase. They tend to be minor components only of most plant and animal tissues, and indeed would not be expected to accumulate because their strong detergent properties would have a disruptive effect on membranes. 2-Monoacylglycerols are a major end product of the intestinal digestion of dietary fats in animals via the enzyme pancreatic lipase. They are taken up directly by the intestinal cells and converted to triacylglycerols via the monoacylglycerol pathway before being transported in lymph to the liver. Mono- and Diglycerides are commonly added to commercial food products in small quantities. They act as emulsifiers, helping to mix ingredients such as oil and water that would not otherwise blend well.

383.1165895_MZ	S-Adenosylhomocysteine	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	S-Adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) is the immediate precursor of all of the homocysteine produced in the body. The reaction is catalyzed by S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and is reversible with the equilibrium favoring formation of AdoHcy. In vivo, the reaction is driven in the direction of homocysteine formation by the action of the enzyme adenosine deaminase, which converts the second product of the S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase reaction, adenosine, to inosine. Except for methyl transfer from betaine and from methylcobalamin in the methionine synthase reaction, AdoHcy is the product of all methylation reactions that involve S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) as the methyl donor. Methylation is significant in epigenetic regulation of protein expression via DNA and histone methylation. The inhibition of these AdoMet-mediated processes by AdoHcy is a proven mechanism for metabolic alteration. Because the conversion of AdoHcy to homocysteine is reversible, with the equilibrium favoring the formation of AdoHcy, increases in plasma homocysteine are accompanied by an elevation of AdoHcy in most cases. Disturbances in the transmethylation pathway indicated by abnormal S-adenosylmethionine, S-adenosylhomocysteine or their ratio have been reported in many neurodegenerative diseases, such as dementia, depression or Parkinson's disease.

383.3151382_MZ	Monoacylglyceride with formula C23H44O4	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	MG(0:0/20:1(11Z)/0:0) is a monoacylglyceride. A monoglyceride, more correctly known as a monoacylglycerol, is a glyceride consisting of one fatty acid chain covalently bonded to a glycerol molecule through an ester linkage. Monoacylglycerol can be broadly divided into two groups; 1-monoacylglycerols (or 3-monoacylglycerols) and 2-monoacylglycerols, depending on the position of the ester bond on the glycerol moiety. Normally the 1-/3-isomers are not distinguished from each other and are termed 'alpha-monoacylglycerols', while the 2-isomers are beta-monoacylglycerols. Monoacylglycerols are formed biochemically via release of a fatty acid from diacylglycerol by diacylglycerol lipase or hormone sensitive lipase. Monoacylglycerols are broken down by monoacylglycerol lipase. They tend to be minor components only of most plant and animal tissues, and indeed would not be expected to accumulate because their strong detergent properties would have a disruptive effect on membranes. 2-Monoacylglycerols are a major end product of the intestinal digestion of dietary fats in animals via the enzyme pancreatic lipase. They are taken up directly by the intestinal cells and converted to triacylglycerols via the monoacylglycerol pathway before being transported in lymph to the liver. Mono- and Diglycerides are commonly added to commercial food products in small quantities. They act as emulsifiers, helping to mix ingredients such as oil and water that would not otherwise blend well.

The distinction between different bile acids is minute, depends only on presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g., membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues.

Monoacylglycerol can be broadly divided into two groups; 1-monoacylglycerols (or 3-monoacylglycerols) and 2-monoacylglycerols, depending on the position of the ester bond on the glycerol moiety. Normally the 1-/3-isomers are not distinguished from each other and are termed 'alpha-monoacylglycerols', while the 2-isomers are beta-monoacylglycerols. Monoacylglycerols are formed biochemically via release of a fatty acid from diacylglycerol by diacylglycerol lipase or hormone sensitive lipase. Monoacylglycerols are broken down by monoacylglycerol lipase.

409.2350740_MZ	LPA with formula C19H39O7P	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	LPA(0:0/16:0) is a lysophosphatidic acid. It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphate moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. Lysophosphatidic acids can have different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 (sn-1) or C-2 (sn-2) position. Fatty acids containing 16 and 18 carbons are the most common. Lysophosphatidic acid is the simplest possible glycerophospholipid. It is the biosynthetic precursor of phosphatidic acid. Although it is present at very low levels only in animal tissues, it is extremely important biologically, influencing many biochemical processes. In particular, lysophosphatidic acid is an intercellular lipid mediator with growth factor-like activities, and is rapidly produced and released from activated platelets to influence target cells. 1-Palmitoyl lysophosphatidic acid is the major component of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in plasma, and is in a reduced ratio in individuals with gynecological cancers (PMID 11585410). LPA is a pluripotent lipid mediator controlling growth, motility, and differentiation, that has a strong influence on the chemotaxis and ultrastructure of human neutrophils (PMID 7416233). In serum and plasma, LPA is mainly converted from lysophospholipids, whereas in platelets and some cancer cells it is converted from phosphatidic acid. In each pathway, at least two phospholipase activities are required: phospholipase A1 (PLA1)/PLA2 plus lysophospholipase D (lysoPLD) activities are involved in the first pathway and phospholipase D (PLD) plus PLA1/PLA2 activities are involved in the second pathway.

416.3041499_MZ	11'-Carboxy-alpha-chromanol	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	11'-carboxy-alpha-tocopherol is a dehydrogenation carboxylate product of 11'-hydroxy-a-tocopherol by an unidentified microsomal enzyme(s) probably via an aldehyde intermediate.  The tocopherols ( a-tocopherol , b-tocopherol ,r-tocopherol and d-tocopherol ) and their corresponding tocotrienols are synthesized by plants and have vitamin E antixoidant activity (see pathway vitamin E biosynthesis ). They differ in the number and location of methyl groups on the chromanol ring. The naturally occurring form of a-tocopherol is (2R,4'R,8'R)-a-tocopherol (synonym (R,R,R)-a-tocopherol). Synthetic a-tocopherols are a racemic mixture of eight different R and S stereoisomers. Only the 2R forms are recognized as meeting human requirements. The in vivo function of vitamin E is to scavenge peroxyl radicals via its phenolic (chromanol) hydroxyl group, thus protecting lipids against free radical-catalyzed peroxidation. The tocopheryl radical formed can then be reduced by reductants such as L-ascorbate. Other major products of a-tocopherol oxidation include &#945;-tocopherylquinone and epoxy-a-tocopherols. The metabolites a-tocopheronic acid and its lactone, known as the Simon metabolites, are generally believed to be artefacts. In addition to these oxidation products, the other major class of tocopherol metabolites is the carboxyethyl-hydroxychromans.These metabolites are produced in significant amounts in response to excess vitamin E ingestion. Vitamin E is fat-soluble and its utilization requires intestinal fat absorption mechanisms. It is secreted from the intestine into the lymphatic system in chylomicrons which subsequently enter the plasma. Lipolysis of these chylomicrons can result in delivery of vitamin E to tissues, transfer to high-density lipoproteins (and subsequently to other lipoproteins via the phospholipid exchange protein), or retention in chylomicron remnants. These remnants are taken up by the liver. Natural (R,R,R)-&#945;-tocopherol and synthetic 2R-&#945;-tocopherols are then preferentially secreted from the liver into plasma as a result of the specificity of the &#945;-tocopherol transfer protein. This protein, along with the metabolism of excess vitamin E in the liver and excretion into urine and bile, mediate the supply of a-tocopherol in plasma and tissues.

418.3330854_MZ	L-Palmitoylcarnitine	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	L-Palmitoylcarnitine is a long-chain acyl fatty acid derivative ester of carnitine which facilitates the transfer of long-chain fatty acids from cytoplasm into mitochondria during the oxidation of fatty acids. L-palmitoylcarnitine, due to its amphipatic character is, like detergents, a surface-active molecule and by changing the membrane fluidity and surface charge can change activity of several enzymes and transporters localized in the membrane. L-palmitoylcarnitine has been also reported to change the activity of certain proteins. On the contrary to carnitine, palmitoylcarnitine was shown to stimulate the activity of caspases 3, 7 and 8 and the level of this long-chain acylcarnitine increased during apoptosis. Palmitoylcarnitine was also reported to diminish completely binding of phorbol esters, the protein kinase C activators and to decrease the autophosphorylation of the enzyme. Apart from these isoform nonspecific phenomena, palmitoylcarnitine was also shown to be responsible for retardation in cytoplasm of protein kinase C isoforms &#946; and &#948; and, in the case of the latter one, to decrease its interaction with GAP-43. Some of the physico-chemical properties of palmitoylcarnitine may help to explain the need for coenzyme A-carnitine-coenzyme A acyl exchange during mitochondrial fatty acid import. The amphiphilic character of palmitoylcarnitine may also explain its proposed involvement in the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia. L-Palmitoylcarnitine accumulates in ischemic myocardium and potentially contribute to myocardial damage through alterations in membrane molecular dynamics , one mechanism through which could play an important role in ischemic injury. Palmitoylcarnitine is characteristically elevated in carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency, late-onset (OMIM 255110). (PMID 2540838, 15363641, 8706815).

419.2556469_MZ	Cyclic phosphatidic acid with formula C21H41O6P	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	cPA(18:0/0:0) is a cyclic phosphatidic acid or cyclic lysophosphatidic acid. It is a glycerophospholipid in which a cyclic phosphate moiety occupies two glycerol substitution sites. Lysophosphatidic acids can have different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 (sn-1). Fatty acids containing 16 and 18 carbons are the most common. Cyclic phosphatidic acids have been detected in a wide range of organisms including humans, especially in the brain but also in serum (at a concentration of 10-7M). cPA's have a cyclic phosphate at the sn-2 and sn-3 positions of the glycerol carbons, and this structure is absolutely necessary for their activities. In particular, it is found in tissues subject to injury, and while it may have some similar signalling functions to lysophosphatidic acid per se, it also has some quite distinct biological activities. For example, cyclic phosphatidic acid is known to be a specific inhibitor of DNA polymerase alpha. It has an appreciable effect on the inhibition of cancer cell invasion and metastasis.

424.1435932_MZ	Hyaluronic acid	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Hyaluronic acid (HA), is the most abundant glycosaminoglycan (GAG) in mammalian tissue. It is present in high concentrations in connective tissue, such as skin, vitreous humor, cartilage, and umbilical cord, but the largest single reservoir is the synovial fluid (SF) of the diarthrodial joints, where concentrations of 0.5-4 mg/mL are achieved. Hyaluronic acid, is the major hydrodynamic nonprotein component of joint SF. Its unique viscoelastic properties confer remarkable shock absorbing and lubricating abilities to SF, while its enormous macromolecular size and hydrophilicity serve to retain fluid in the joint cavity during articulation. HA restricts the entry of large plasma proteins and cells into SF but facilitates solute exchange between the synovial capillaries and cartilage and other joint tissues. In addition, HA can form a pericellular coat around cells, interact with proinflammatory mediators, and bind to cell receptors, such as cluster determinant (CD)44 and receptor for hyaluronate-mediated motility (RHAMM), where it modulates cell proliferation, migration, and gene expression. All these physicochemical and biologic properties of HA have been shown to be molecular weight (MW) dependent. The diverse physicochemical properties of HA arise from its unique macromolecular structure. The HA is an exceptionally long (3-30 &#956;m) and unbranched nonsulfated GAG composed of repeating disaccharide units of N-acetylglucosamine, and glucuronic acid glycosidically linked through their respective 1-4 ring positions. Hydroxyl group oxygens at the glucuronyl-1 and glucosamine 3-positions are used for further polymerization of the HA disaccharide units to form chains that, when released from the cell plasma membrane, are of variable length and thus polydispersity. Despite the simplicity of the HA primary structure, this linear polyelectrolyte adopts complex conformations in solution, which engender it with diverse biologic properties. Within the joint cavity, HA molecules are predominately synthesized by the type B synovial cells. (PMID 12219318).

It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphate moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. Lysophosphatidic acids can have different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 (sn-1) or C-2 (sn-2) position. Fatty acids containing 16 and 18 carbons are the most common. Lysophosphatidic acid is the simplest possible glycerophospholipid. It is the biosynthetic precursor of phosphatidic acid. Although it is present at very low levels only in animal tissues, it is extremely important biologically, influencing many biochemical processes. In particular, lysophosphatidic acid is an intercellular lipid mediator with growth factor-like activities, and is rapidly produced and released from activated platelets to influence target cells. 1-Palmitoyl lysophosphatidic acid is the major component of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in plasma, and is in a reduced ratio in individuals with gynecological cancers (PMID 11585410). LPA is a pluripotent lipid mediator controlling growth, motility, and differentiation, that has a strong influence on the chemotaxis and ultrastructure of human neutrophils (PMID 7416233). In serum and plasma, LPA is mainly converted from lysophospholipids, whereas in platelets and some cancer cells it is converted from phosphatidic acid. In each pathway, at least two phospholipase activities are required: phospholipase A1 (PLA1)/PLA2 plus lysophospholipase D (lysoPLD) activities are involved in the first pathway and phospholipase D (PLD) plus PLA1/PLA2 activities are involved in the second pathway.

Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in bile of mammals. The distinction between different bile acids is minute, depends only on presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g., membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues.

435.2494479_MZ	DHAP(18:0)	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	DHAP(18:0) is the octadecanoyl derivative of dihydroxyacetone phosphate. It is also known as an alkyl-DHAP. This compound is formed by octadecanoic acid reacting with DHAP. Alkyl-DHAPs are intermediates in the synthesis of ether phospholipids. The initial steps of ether phospholipid biosynthesis take place in peroxisomes. Alkyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase is the peroxisomal enzyme that actually introduces the ether linkage. Levels of Alkyl-DHAP have been found to be strongly reduced in human fibroblasts derived from Zellweger syndrome and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata patients. Four other enzymes are known to be involved in the metabolism of acyl-DHAP and alkyl-DHAP. These include: acyl-DHAP/alkyl-DHAP oxidoreductase, DHAP acyltransferase, alkyl-DHAP phosphohydrolase, and a dinitrofluorobenzene-insensitive acyl-DHAP acylhydrolase. Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) is a biochemical compound primarily involved in the glycolysis metabolic pathway. DHAP is also the product of the dehydrogenation of L-glycerol-3-phosphate which is part of the entry of glycerol (sourced from triglycerides) into the glycolytic pathway. Conversely, reduction of glycolysis-derived DHAP to L-glycerol-3-phosphate provides adipose cells with the activated glycerol backbone they require to synthesize new triglycerides. Both reactions are catalyzed by the enzyme glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase with NAD+/NADH as cofactor. DHAP may be referred to as glycerone phosphate in older texts. 1-Octadecyl-glycerone-3-phosphate is an intermediate in Ether lipid metabolism. DHAP(18:0) or 1-Octadecanoyl-glycerone-3-phosphate is the precursor to 1-Octadecyl-glycerone-3-phosphate DHAP(18:0e) which is generated via alkylglycerone phosphate synthase (EC: 2.5.1.26). Ether lipids are lipids in which one or more of the carbon atoms on glycerol is bonded to an alkyl chain via an ether linkage, as opposed to the usual ester linkage. Ether lipids are called plasmalogens (1-O-1'-alkenyl-2-acylglycerophospholipids) if these are glycerol-containing phospholipids with an unsaturated O-(1-alkenyl) (vinyl ether) group at the first position on the glycerol chain. Plasmalogens as well as some 1-O-alkyl lipids are ubiquitous and sometimes major parts of the cell membranes in mammals and anaerobic bacteria. In archaea, ether lipids are the major polar lipids in the cell envelope and their abundance is one of the major characteristics that separate this group of prokaryotes from the bacteria. In these cells, diphytanylglycerolipids or bipolar macrocyclic tetraethers can form covalently linked 'bilayers'.

The term 'lysophospholipid' (LPL) refers to any phospholipid that is missing one of its two O-acyl chains. Thus, LPLs have a free alcohol in either the sn-1 or sn-2 position. The prefix 'lyso-' comes from the fact that lysophospholipids were originally found to be hemolytic however it is now used to refer generally to phospholipids missing an acyl chain. LPLs are usually the result of phospholipase A-type enzymatic activity on regular phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidic acid, although they can also be generated by the acylation of glycerophospholipids or the phosphorylation of monoacylglycerols. Some LPLs serve important signaling functions such as lysophosphatidic acid. Lysophosphatidylethanolamines (LPEs) can function as plant growth regulators with several diverse uses.

445.3678756_MZ	13'-hydroxy-alpha-tocopherol	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	13'-hydroxy-alpha-tocopherol is the precursor in dehydrogenation to 13'-carboxy-alpha-tocopherol by an unidentified microsomal enzyme(s) probably via an aldehyde intermediate. The tocopherols ( a-tocopherol , b-tocopherol ,r-tocopherol and d-tocopherol ) and their corresponding tocotrienols are synthesized by plants and have vitamin E antixoidant activity (see pathway vitamin E biosynthesis ). They differ in the number and location of methyl groups on the chromanol ring. The naturally occurring form of a-tocopherol is (2R,4'R,8'R)-a-tocopherol (synonym (R,R,R)-a-tocopherol). Synthetic a-tocopherols are a racemic mixture of eight different R and S stereoisomers. Only the 2R forms are recognized as meeting human requirements. The in vivo function of vitamin E is to scavenge peroxyl radicals via its phenolic (chromanol) hydroxyl group, thus protecting lipids against free radical-catalyzed peroxidation. The tocopheryl radical formed can then be reduced by reductants such as L-ascorbate. Other major products of a-tocopherol oxidation include &#945;-tocopherylquinone and epoxy-a-tocopherols. The metabolites a-tocopheronic acid and its lactone, known as the Simon metabolites, are generally believed to be artefacts. In addition to these oxidation products, the other major class of tocopherol metabolites is the carboxyethyl-hydroxychromans.These metabolites are produced in significant amounts in response to excess vitamin E ingestion. Vitamin E is fat-soluble and its utilization requires intestinal fat absorption mechanisms. It is secreted from the intestine into the lymphatic system in chylomicrons which subsequently enter the plasma. Lipolysis of these chylomicrons can result in delivery of vitamin E to tissues, transfer to high-density lipoproteins (and subsequently to other lipoproteins via the phospholipid exchange protein), or retention in chylomicron remnants. These remnants are taken up by the liver. Natural (R,R,R)-&#945;-tocopherol and synthetic 2R-&#945;-tocopherols are then preferentially secreted from the liver into plasma as a result of the specificity of the &#945;-tocopherol transfer protein. This protein, along with the metabolism of excess vitamin E in the liver and excretion into urine and bile, mediate the supply of a-tocopherol in plasma and tissues.

Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g., membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues.

The term 'lysophospholipid' (LPL) refers to any phospholipid that is missing one of its two O-acyl chains. Thus, LPLs have a free alcohol in either the sn-1 or sn-2 position. The prefix 'lyso-' comes from the fact that lysophospholipids were originally found to be hemolytic however it is now used to refer generally to phospholipids missing an acyl chain. LPLs are usually the result of phospholipase A-type enzymatic activity on regular phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidic acid, although they can also be generated by the acylation of glycerophospholipids or the phosphorylation of monoacylglycerols. Some LPLs serve important signaling functions such as lysophosphatidic acid. Lysophosphatidylethanolamines (LPEs) can function as plant growth regulators with several diverse uses. (LPEs) are approved for outdoor agricultural use to accelerate ripening and improve the quality of fresh produce.

LTE4, activate contractile and inflammatory processes via specific interaction with putative seven transmembrane-spanning receptors that couple to G proteins and subsequent intracellular signaling pathways. LTE4 is metabolized from leukotriene C4 in a reaction catalyzed by gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and a particulate dipeptidase from kidney. (PMID: 12607939, 12432945, 6311078). Leukotrienes are eicosanoids. The eicosanoids consist of the prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes (TXs), leukotrienes (LTs) and lipoxins (LXs). The PGs and TXs are collectively identified as prostanoids. Prostaglandins were originally shown to be synthesized in the prostate gland, thromboxanes from platelets (thrombocytes) and leukotrienes from leukocytes, hence the derivation of their names. All mammalian cells except erythrocytes synthesize eicosanoids. These molecules are extremely potent, able to cause profound physiological effects at very dilute concentrations.

Numerous disorders have been described that lead to disturbances in energy production and in intermediary metabolism in the organism which are characterized by the production and excretion of unusual acylcarnitines. A mutation in the gene coding for carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase or the OCTN2 transporter aetiologically causes a carnitine deficiency that results in poor intestinal absorption of dietary L-carnitine, its impaired reabsorption by the kidney and, consequently, in increased urinary loss of L-carnitine. Determination of the qualitative pattern of acylcarnitines can be of diagnostic and therapeutic importance. The betaine structure of carnitine requires special analytical procedures for recording. The ionic nature of L-carnitine causes a high water solubility which decreases with increasing chain length of the ester group in the acylcarnitines. Therefore, the distribution of L-carnitine and acylcarnitines in various organs is defined by their function and their physico-chemical properties as well. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) permits screening for free and total carnitine, as well as complete quantitative acylcarnitine determination, including the long-chain acylcarnitine profile.

469.3519518_MZ	Tricaprylic glyceride with formula C27H50O6	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	TG(8:0/8:0/8:0) or tricaprylic glyceride is a trioctanoic acid triglyceride or medium chain triglyceride. Triglycerides (TGs) are also known as triacylglycerols or triacylglycerides, meaning that they are glycerides in which the glycerol is esterified with three fatty acid groups (i.e. fatty acid tri-esters of glycerol). TGs may be divided into three general types with respect to their acyl substituents. They are simple or monoacid if they contain only one type of fatty acid, diacid if they contain two types of fatty acids and triacid if three different acyl groups. Chain lengths of the fatty acids in naturally occurring triglycerides can be of varying lengths and saturations but 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. TG(8:0/8:0/8:0), in particular, consists of one chain of octanoic acid at the C-1 position, one chain of octanoic acid at the C-2 position and one chain of octanoic acid at the C-3 position. TGs are the main constituent of vegetable oil and animal fats. TGs are major components of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicrons, play an important role in metabolism as energy sources and transporters of dietary fat. They contain more than twice the energy (9 kcal/g) of carbohydrates and proteins. In the intestine, triglycerides are split into glycerol and fatty acids (this process is called lipolysis) with the help of lipases and bile secretions, which can then move into blood vessels. The triglycerides are rebuilt in the blood from their fragments and become constituents of lipoproteins, which deliver the fatty acids to and from fat cells among other functions. Various tissues can release the free fatty acids and take them up as a source of energy. Fat cells can synthesize and store triglycerides. When the body requires fatty acids as an energy source, the hormone glucagon signals the breakdown of the triglycerides by hormone-sensitive lipase to release free fatty acids. As the brain cannot utilize fatty acids as an energy source, the glycerol component of triglycerides can be converted into glucose for brain fuel when it is broken down. (www.cyberlipid.org, www.wikipedia.org)TAGs can serve as fatty acid stores in all cells, but primarily in adipocytes of adipose tissue. The major building block for the synthesis of triacylglycerides, in non-adipose tissue, is glycerol. Adipocytes lack glycerol kinase and so must use another route to TAG synthesis. Specifically, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), which is produced during glycolysis, is the precursor for TAG synthesis in adipose tissue. DHAP can also serve as a TAG precursor in non-adipose tissues, but does so to a much lesser extent than glycerol. The use of DHAP for the TAG backbone depends on whether the synthesis of the TAGs occurs in the mitochondria and ER or the ER and the peroxisomes. The ER/mitochondria pathway requires the action of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to convert DHAP to glycerol-3-phosphate. Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase then esterifies a fatty acid to glycerol-3-phosphate thereby generating lysophosphatidic acid. The ER/peroxisome reaction pathway uses the peroxisomal enzyme DHAP acyltransferase to acylate DHAP to acyl-DHAP which is then reduced by acyl-DHAP reductase. The fatty acids that are incorporated into TAGs are activated to acyl-CoAs through the action of acyl-CoA synthetases. Two molecules of acyl-CoA are esterified to glycerol-3-phosphate to yield 1,2-diacylglycerol phosphate (also known as phosphatidic acid). The phosphate is then removed by phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP1), to generate 1,2-diacylglycerol. This diacylglycerol serves as the substrate for addition of the third fatty acid to make TAG. Intestinal monoacylglycerols, derived from dietary fats, can also serve as substrates for the synthesis of 1,2-diacylglycerols.

It was initially studied for use in hypertension (high blood pressure) and angina pectoris (a form of ischaemic cardiovascular disease). Phase I clinical trials under the direction of Ian Osterloh suggested that the drug had little effect on angina, but that it could induce marked penile erections; Sildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. The molecular structure of sildenafil is similar to that of cGMP and acts as a competitive binding agent of PDE5 in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in more cGMP and better erections. Without sexual stimulation, and therefore lack of activation of the NO/cGMP system, sildenafil should not cause an erection. Other drugs that operate by the same mechanism include tadalafil (Cialis) and vardenafil (Levitra); Sildenafil citrate, sold under the names Viagra, Revatio and generically under various other names, is a drug used to treat male erectile dysfunction (impotence) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), developed by the pharmaceutical company Pfizer. Viagra pills are blue and diamond-shaped with the words 'Pfizer' on one side, and 'VGR xx' (where xx stands for '25', '50' or '100', the dose of that pill in milligrams) on the other. Its primary competitors on the market are tadalafil (Cialis), and vardenafil (Levitra).

Bile alcohols are preferentially excreted as glucuronides into the urine, which constitute about 10% of total bile acids. The excretion of glucuronidated bile alcohols in urine is suggested to reflect an alternative metabolism of intermediates in the normal biosynthesis of bile acids. (PMID: 6548247, 11718684).

478.1847716_MZ	5-Methyltetrahydrofolic acid	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	5 methyltetrahydrofolic acid (5-MTHF) is the most biologically active form of the B-vitamin known as folic acid, also known generically as folate. 5-MTHF functions, in concert with vitamin B12, as a methyl-group donor involved in the conversion of the amino acid homocysteine to methionine. Methyl (CH3) group donation is vital to many bodily processes, including serotonin, melatonin, and DNA synthesis. Therapeutically, 5-MTHF is instrumental in reducing homocysteine levels, preventing neural tube defects, and improving vascular endothelial function. Research on folate supplementation suggests it plays a key role in preventing cervical dysplasia and protecting against neoplasia in ulcerative colitis. Folic acid also shows promise as part of a nutritional protocol to treat vitiligo, and may reduce inflammation of the gingiva. Furthermore, certain neurological, cognitive, and psychiatric presentations may be secondary to folate deficiency. Such presentations include depression, peripheral neuropathy, myelopathy, restless legs syndrome, insomnia, dementia, forgetfulness, irritability, endogenous depression, organic psychosis, and schizophrenia-like syndromes. After ingestion, the process of conversion of folic acid to the metabolically active coenzyme forms is relatively complex. Synthesis of the active forms of folic acid requires several enzymes, adequate liver and intestinal function, and adequate supplies of riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), pyridoxine (B6), zinc, vitamin C, and serine. After formation of the coenzyme forms of the vitamin in the liver, these metabolically active compounds are secreted into the small intestine with bile (the folate enterohepatic cycle), where they are reabsorbed and distributed to tissues throughout the body. Human pharmacokinetic studies indicate folic acid has high bioavailability, with large oral doses of folic acid substantially raising plasma levels in healthy subjects in a time and dose dependent manner. Red blood cells (RBCs) appear to be the storage depot for folic acid, as RBC levels remain elevated for periods in excess of 40 days following discontinuation of supplementation. Folic acid is poorly transported to the brain and rapidly cleared from the central nervous system. The primary methods of elimination of absorbed folic acid are fecal (through bile) and urinary. Despite the biochemical complexity of this process, evidence suggests oral supplementation with folic acid increases the body's pool of 5-MTHF in healthy individuals. However, enzyme defects, mal-absorption, digestive system pathology, and liver disease can result in impaired ability to activate folic acid. In fact, some individuals have a severe congenital deficiency of the enzyme Methyl tetrahydrofolate reductase (5-MTHFR), which is needed to convert folic acid to 5-MTHF. Milder forms of this enzyme defect likely interact with dietary folate status to determine risk for some disease conditions. In individuals with a genetic defect of this enzyme (whether mild or severe), supplementation with 5- MTHF might be preferable to folic acid supplementation. (PMID: 17176169).

The term 'lysophospholipid' (LPL) refers to any phospholipid that is missing one of its two O-acyl chains. Thus, LPLs have a free alcohol in either the sn-1 or sn-2 position. The prefix 'lyso-' comes from the fact that lysophospholipids were originally found to be hemolytic however it is now used to refer generally to phospholipids missing an acyl chain. LPLs are usually the result of phospholipase A-type enzymatic activity on regular phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidic acid, although they can also be generated by the acylation of glycerophospholipids or the phosphorylation of monoacylglycerols. Some LPLs serve important signaling functions such as lysophosphatidic acid. Lysophosphatidylethanolamines (LPEs) can function as plant growth regulators with several diverse uses. (LPEs) are approved for outdoor agricultural use to accelerate ripening and improve the quality of fresh produce. They are also approved for indoor use to preserve stored crops and commercial cut flowers. As a breakdown product of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), LPE is present in cells of all organisms.

It is used in flavouring and it masks the bitter taste of drugs like aloe and quinine. It is effective in the treatment of peptic ulcer and also has expectorant (antitussive) properties (Chandler,1985). In glycyrrhetinic acid the functional group (R) is a hydroxyl group. Research in 2005 demonstrated that with a proper functional group a very effective glycyrrhetinic artificial sweetener can be obtained. When R is an anionic NHCO(CH2)CO2K side chain, the sweetening effect is found to 1200 times that of sugar (human sensory panel data). A shorter or longer spacer reduces the sweetening effect. One explanation is that the taste bud cell receptor has 1.3 nanometers (13 angstroms) available for docking with the sweetener molecule. In addition the sweetener molecule requires three proton donor positions of which two reside at the extremities to be able to interact efficiently with the receptor cavity (Wikipedia).

495.2662560_MZ	APGPR Enterostatin	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Enterostatin APGPR (Ala-Pro-Gly-Pro-Arg) is a pentapeptide released from procolipase during fat digestion. In addition to the pancreas, enterostatin-immunoreactive cells are also present in the antrum and proximal small intestine. Enterostatin selectively reduces fat intake, decreases insulin secretion, and also increases energy expenditure by activating brown adipose tissue during high-fat feeding. Enterostatins are pentapeptides derived from the NH2-terminus of procolipase after tryptic cleavage and belong to the family of gut-brain peptides. Enterostatin is generated by the action of trypsin on procolipase in the intestinal lumen. Its structure is highly conserved in evolution, with an amino acid sequence of XPXPR. Three enterostatin sequences, Val-Pro-Asp-Pro-Arg (VPDPR), Val-Pro-Gly-Pro-Arg (VPGPR), and Ala-Pro-Gly-Pro-Arg (APGPR), have been studied extensively and shown to be almost equally effective in their ability to decrease dietary fat preference. Enterostatins are selective inhibitors of appetite, particularly of fat intake. Hyperenterostatinemia in obesity is probably secondary to enterostatin resistance; therefore, the regulatory system is producing more enterostatin to counteract the resistance. This is very similar to hyperinsulinemia and hyperleptinemia in obesity. The diminution in the meal-induced secretion of enterostatin in obesity suggests a delay in the appearance of satiety, leading to increased caloric intake. In rats enterostatin decreases body weight by decreasing fat-calorie intake and increasing the sympathetic firing rate of the nerves in interscapular brown adipose tissue. Enterostatin levels are elevated in the plasma of obese women, and enterostatin secretion is diminished after satiety. Oral administration of enterostatin, however, has no effect on food intake, energy expenditure, or body weight in subjects with a preference for a high-fat diet experiencing a negative energy and fat balance, and the physiology of enterostatin in humans remains to be defined.

498.2885195_MZ	Taurochenodesoxycholic acid	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Taurochenodesoxycholic acid is a bile acid formed in the liver by conjugation of chenodeoxycholate with taurine, usually as the sodium salt. Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in bile of mammals. The distinction between different bile acids is minute, depends only on presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues.

505.9878006_MZ	Adenosine triphosphate	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a nucleotide consisting of a purine base (adenine) attached to the first carbon atom of ribose (a pentose sugar). Three phosphate groups are esterified at the fifth carbon atom of the ribose. ATP is incorporated into nucleic acids by polymerases in the processes of DNA replication and transcription. ATP contributes to cellular energy charge and participates in overall energy balance, maintaining cellular homeostasis. ATP can act as an extracellular signaling molecule via interactions with specific purinergic receptors to mediate a wide variety of processes as diverse as neurotransmission, inflammation, apoptosis, and bone remodelling. Extracellular ATP and its metabolite adenosine have also been shown to exert a variety of effects on nearly every cell type in human skin, and ATP seems to play a direct role in triggering skin inflammatory, regenerative, and fibrotic responses to mechanical injury, an indirect role in melanocyte proliferation and apoptosis, and a complex role in Langerhans cell-directed adaptive immunity. During exercise, intracellular homeostasis depends on the matching of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) supply and ATP demand. Metabolites play a useful role in communicating the extent of ATP demand to the metabolic supply pathways. Effects as different as proliferation or differentiation, chemotaxis, release of cytokines or lysosomal constituents, and generation of reactive oxygen or nitrogen species are elicited upon stimulation of blood cells with extracellular ATP. The increased concentration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in erythrocytes from patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) has been observed in many studies but the mechanism leading to these abnormalities still is controversial.

Relatively high levels of ITP in red cells are found in individuals as result of deficiency of inosine triphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.56, ITPase) ITPase is a cytosolic nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase specific for ITP catalysis to inosine monophosphate (IMP) and deoxy-inosine triphosphate (dITP) to deoxy-inosine monophosphate. ITPase deficiency is not associated with any defined pathology other than the characteristic and abnormal accumulation of ITP in red blood cells. Nevertheless, ITPase deficiency may have pharmacogenomic implications, and the abnormal metabolism of 6-mercaptopurine in ITPase-deficient patients may lead to thiopurine drug toxicity. ITPase's function is not clearly understood but possible roles for ITPase could be to prevent the accumulation of rogue nucleotides which would be otherwise incorporated into DNA and RNA, or compete with nucleotides such as GTP in signalling processes.

514.2842602_MZ	Taurocholic acid	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Taurocholic acid is a bile acid and is the product of conjugation of cholic acid with taurine. Its sodium salt is the chief ingredient of the bile of carnivorous animals. Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in bile of mammals. The distinction between different bile acids is minute, depends only on presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g., membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues. (PMID: 11316487 , 16037564 , 12576301 , 11907135 ) Taurocholic acid, as with all bile acids, acts as a detergent to solubilize fats for absorption and is itself absorbed. It is used as a cholagogue and cholerectic (a bile purging agent). Hydrolysis of taurocholic acid yields taurine, a nonessential amino acid. Taurocholic acid is one of the main components of urinary nonsulfated bile acids in biliary atresia. Raised levels of the bile acid taurocholate in the fetal serum in obstetric cholestasis may result in the development of a fetal dysrhythmia and in sudden intra-uterine death.

It is a coordination complex formed between molybdopterin (which, despite the name, does not contain molybdenum) and an oxide of molybdenum. Molybdopterins, in turn, are synthesized from guanosine triphosphate. Molybdenum cofactor functions directly in ethylbenzene dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate ferredoxin oxidoreductase, and respiratory arsenate reductase. In animals and plants these enzymes use molybdenum bound at the active site in a tricyclic molybdenum cofactor. All molybdenum-using enzymes so far identified in nature use this cofactor The simplest structure of molybdopterin contains a pyranopterin coordinated to molybdenum. The pyranopterin structure is a fused ring system containing a pyran fused to pterin. In addition, the pyran ring is substituted with two thiols and an alkyl phosphate. In molybdopterin, the thiols coordinate to molybdenum. In some cases, the alkyl phosphate group is replaced by an alkyl diphosphate nucleotide. -- Wikipedia.

GTP functions as a carrier of phosphates and pyrophosphates involved in channeling chemical energy into specific biosynthetic pathways. GTP activates the signal transducing G proteins which are involved in various cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and activation of several intracellular kinase cascades. Proliferation and apoptosis are regulated in part by the hydrolysis of GTP by small GTPases Ras and Rho. Another type of small GTPase, Rab, plays a role in the docking and fusion of vesicles and may also be involved in vesicle formation. In addition to its role in signal transduction, GTP also serves as an energy-rich precursor of mononucleotide units in the enzymatic biosynthesis of DNA and RNA.

Mono- and diacylglycerols are common food additives used to blend together certain ingredients, such as oil and water, which would not otherwise blend well. Dacylglycerols are often found in bakery products, beverages, ice cream, chewing gum, shortening, whipped toppings, margarine, and confections. Synthesis of diacylglycerol begins with glycerol-3-phosphate, which is derived primarily from dihydroxyacetone phosphate, a product of glycolysis (usually in the cytoplasm of liver or adipose tissue cells). Glycerol-3-phosphate is first acylated with acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) to form lysophosphatidic acid, which is then acylated with another molecule of acyl-CoA to yield phosphatidic acid. Phosphatidic acid is then de-phosphorylated to form diacylglycerol.Diacylglycerols are precursors to triacylglycerols (triglyceride), which are formed by the addition of a third fatty acid to the diacylglycerol under the catalysis of diglyceride acyltransferase. Since diacylglycerols are synthesized via phosphatidic acid, they will usually contain a saturated fatty acid at the C-1 position on the glycerol moiety and an unsaturated fatty acid at the C-2 position.

Carotenoids are isoprenoid molecules that are widespread in nature and are typically seen as pigments in fruits, flowers, birds and crustacea. Animals are unable to synthesise carotenoids de novo, and rely upon the diet as a source of these compounds. Over recent years there has been considerable interest in dietary carotenoids with respect to their potential in alleviating age-related diseases in humans. This attention has been mirrored by significant advances in cloning most of the carotenoid genes and in the genetic manipulation of crop plants with the intention of increasing levels in the diet. Studies have shown an inverse relationship between the consumption of certain fruits and vegetables and the risk of epithelial cancer. Since carotenoids are among the micronutrients found in cancer preventive foods, detailed qualitative and quantitative determination of these compounds, particularly in fruits and vegetables and in human plasma, have recently become increasingly important.

DG(14:0/15:0/0:0), in particular, consists of one chain of myristic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of pentadecanoic acid at the C-2 position. The myristic acid moiety is derived from nutmeg and butter, while the pentadecanoic acid moiety is derived from dairy products and milk fat. Mono- and diacylglycerols are common food additives used to blend together certain ingredients, such as oil and water, which would not otherwise blend well. Dacylglycerols are often found in bakery products, beverages, ice cream, chewing gum, shortening, whipped toppings, margarine, and confections. Synthesis of diacylglycerol begins with glycerol-3-phosphate, which is derived primarily from dihydroxyacetone phosphate, a product of glycolysis (usually in the cytoplasm of liver or adipose tissue cells). Glycerol-3-phosphate is first acylated with acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) to form lysophosphatidic acid, which is then acylated with another molecule of acyl-CoA to yield phosphatidic acid. Phosphatidic acid is then de-phosphorylated to form diacylglycerol.Diacylglycerols are precursors to triacylglycerols (triglyceride), which are formed by the addition of a third fatty acid to the diacylglycerol under the catalysis of diglyceride acyltransferase. Since diacylglycerols are synthesized via phosphatidic acid, they will usually contain a saturated fatty acid at the C-1 position on the glycerol moiety and an unsaturated fatty acid at the C-2 position.

It is a monoglycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylcholine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. Lysophosphatidylcholines can have different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 (sn-1) position. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. LysoPC(20:2(11Z,14Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of eicosadienoic acid at the C-1 position. The eicosadienoic acid moiety is derived from fish oils and liver. Lysophosphatidylcholine is found in small amounts in most tissues. It is formed by hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by the enzyme phospholipase A2, as part of the de-acylation/re-acylation cycle that controls its overall molecular species composition. It can also be formed inadvertently during extraction of lipids from tissues if the phospholipase is activated by careless handling. In blood plasma significant amounts of lysophosphatidylcholine are formed by a specific enzyme system, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), which is secreted from the liver. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of the fatty acids of position sn-2 of phosphatidylcholine to the free cholesterol in plasma, with formation of cholesterol esters and lysophosphatidylcholine. Lysophospholipids have a role in lipid signaling by acting on lysophospholipid receptors (LPL-R). LPL-R's are members of the G protein-coupled receptor family of integral membrane proteins.

Carotenoids are isoprenoid molecules that are widespread in nature and are typically seen as pigments in fruits, flowers, birds and crustacea. Animals are unable to synthesise carotenoids de novo, and rely upon the diet as a source of these compounds. Over recent years there has been considerable interest in dietary carotenoids with respect to their potential in alleviating age-related diseases in humans. This attention has been mirrored by significant advances in cloning most of the carotenoid genes and in the genetic manipulation of crop plants with the intention of increasing levels in the diet. Studies have shown an inverse relationship between the consumption of certain fruits and vegetables and the risk of epithelial cancer. Since carotenoids are among the micronutrients found in cancer preventive foods, detailed qualitative and quantitative determination of these compounds, particularly in fruits and vegetables and in human plasma, have recently become increasingly important.

551.3058019_MZ	5b-Cyprinol sulfate	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	5b-Cyprinol sulfate is an intermediate in bile acid biosynthesis. Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in bile of mammals. The distinction between different bile acids is minute, depends only on presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g., membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues.

553.4456018_MZ	Triglyceride with formula C33H62O6	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	TG(10:0/10:0/10:0) or tricapric glyceride is a tridecanoic acid triglyceride or medium chain triglyceride. Triglycerides (TGs) are also known as triacylglycerols or triacylglycerides, meaning that they are glycerides in which the glycerol is esterified with three fatty acid groups (i.e. fatty acid tri-esters of glycerol). TGs may be divided into three general types with respect to their acyl substituents. They are simple or monoacid if they contain only one type of fatty acid, diacid if they contain two types of fatty acids and triacid if three different acyl groups. Chain lengths of the fatty acids in naturally occurring triglycerides can be of varying lengths and saturations but 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. TG(10:0/10:0/10:0), in particular, consists of one chain of decanoic acid at the C-1 position, one chain of decanoic acid at the C-2 position and one chain of decanoic acid acid at the C-3 position. TGs are the main constituent of vegetable oil and animal fats. TGs are major components of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicrons, play an important role in metabolism as energy sources and transporters of dietary fat. They contain more than twice the energy (9 kcal/g) of carbohydrates and proteins. In the intestine, triglycerides are split into glycerol and fatty acids (this process is called lipolysis) with the help of lipases and bile secretions, which can then move into blood vessels. The triglycerides are rebuilt in the blood from their fragments and become constituents of lipoproteins, which deliver the fatty acids to and from fat cells among other functions. Various tissues can release the free fatty acids and take them up as a source of energy. Fat cells can synthesize and store triglycerides. When the body requires fatty acids as an energy source, the hormone glucagon signals the breakdown of the triglycerides by hormone-sensitive lipase to release free fatty acids. As the brain cannot utilize fatty acids as an energy source, the glycerol component of triglycerides can be converted into glucose for brain fuel when it is broken down. (www.cyberlipid.org, www.wikipedia.org). TAGs can serve as fatty acid stores in all cells, but primarily in adipocytes of adipose tissue. The major building block for the synthesis of triacylglycerides, in non-adipose tissue, is glycerol. Adipocytes lack glycerol kinase and so must use another route to TAG synthesis. Specifically, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), which is produced during glycolysis, is the precursor for TAG synthesis in adipose tissue. DHAP can also serve as a TAG precursor in non-adipose tissues, but does so to a much lesser extent than glycerol. The use of DHAP for the TAG backbone depends on whether the synthesis of the TAGs occurs in the mitochondria and ER or the ER and the peroxisomes. The ER/mitochondria pathway requires the action of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to convert DHAP to glycerol-3-phosphate. Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase then esterifies a fatty acid to glycerol-3-phosphate thereby generating lysophosphatidic acid. The ER/peroxisome reaction pathway uses the peroxisomal enzyme DHAP acyltransferase to acylate DHAP to acyl-DHAP which is then reduced by acyl-DHAP reductase. The fatty acids that are incorporated into TAGs are activated to acyl-CoAs through the action of acyl-CoA synthetases. Two molecules of acyl-CoA are esterified to glycerol-3-phosphate to yield 1,2-diacylglycerol phosphate (also known as phosphatidic acid). The phosphate is then removed by phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP1), to generate 1,2-diacylglycerol. This diacylglycerol serves as the substrate for addition of the third fatty acid to make TAG. Intestinal monoacylglycerols, derived from dietary fats, can also serve as substrates for the synthesis of 1,2-diacylglycerols.

Micromedex, Inc, Engewood, CO, 1995.) -- Pubchem; Carotene is an orange photosynthetic pigment important for photosynthesis. It is responsible for the orange colour of the carrot and many other fruits and vegetables. It contributes to photosynthesis by transmitting the light energy it absorbs to chlorophyll. Chemically, carotene is a terpene. It is the dimer of retinol (vitamin A) and comes in two primary forms: alpha- and beta-carotene. gamma-, delta- and epsilon-carotene also exist. Carotene can be stored in the liver and converted to vitamin A as needed. Beta-carotene is an anti-oxidant and such can be useful for curbing the excess of damaging free radicals in the body. However, the usefulness of beta-carotene as a dietary supplement (i.e. taken as a pill) is still subject to debate. Beta-carotene is fat-soluble, so a small amount of fat is needed to absorb it into the body. -- Wikipedia.

Carotenoids are isoprenoid molecules that are widespread in nature and are typically seen as pigments in fruits, flowers, birds and crustacea. Animals are unable to synthesise carotenoids de novo, and rely upon the diet as a source of these compounds. Over recent years there has been considerable interest in dietary carotenoids with respect to their potential in alleviating age-related diseases in humans. This attention has been mirrored by significant advances in cloning most of the carotenoid genes and in the genetic manipulation of crop plants with the intention of increasing levels in the diet. Studies have shown an inverse relationship between the consumption of certain fruits and vegetables and the risk of epithelial cancer. Since carotenoids are among the micronutrients found in cancer preventive foods, detailed qualitative and quantitative determination of these compounds, particularly in fruits and vegetables and in human plasma, have recently become increasingly important.

It is a monoglycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylcholine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. Lysophosphatidylcholines can have different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 (sn-1) position. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. LysoPC(22:5(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of docosapentaenoic acid at the C-1 position. The docosapentaenoic acid moiety is derived from animal fats and brain. Lysophosphatidylcholine is found in small amounts in most tissues. It is formed by hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by the enzyme phospholipase A2, as part of the de-acylation/re-acylation cycle that controls its overall molecular species composition. It can also be formed inadvertently during extraction of lipids from tissues if the phospholipase is activated by careless handling. In blood plasma significant amounts of lysophosphatidylcholine are formed by a specific enzyme system, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), which is secreted from the liver. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of the fatty acids of position sn-2 of phosphatidylcholine to the free cholesterol in plasma, with formation of cholesterol esters and lysophosphatidylcholine. Lysophospholipids have a role in lipid signaling by acting on lysophospholipid receptors (LPL-R). LPL-R's are members of the G protein-coupled receptor family of integral membrane proteins.

It may also be epimerized to UDP Iduronic acid, which donates Iduronic acid to polysaccharides. In animals, UDP glucuronic acid is used for formation of many glucosiduronides with various aglycones. The transfer of glucuronic acid from UDP-alpha-D-glucuronic acid onto a terminal galactose residue is done by beta1,3-glucuronosyltransferases, responsible for the completion of the protein-glycosaminoglycan linkage region of proteoglycans and of the HNK1 epitope of glycoproteins and glycolipids. In humans the enzyme galactose-beta-1,3-glucuronosyltransferase I completes the synthesis of the common linker region of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) by transferring glucuronic acid (GlcA) onto the terminal galactose of the glycopeptide primer of proteoglycans. The GAG chains of proteoglycans regulate major biological processes such as cell proliferation and recognition, extracellular matrix deposition, and morphogenesis. (PMID: 16815917).

Ceramides are amides of fatty acids with long-chain di- or trihydroxy bases, the commonest in animals being sphingosine and in plants phytosphingosine. The acyl group of ceramides is generally a long-chain saturated or monounsaturated fatty acid. The most frequent fatty acids found in animal ceramides are 18:0, 24:0 and 24:1(n-9). Ceramide 1-phosphates are produced by phosphorylation of ceramide by a specific ceramide kinase. Ceramide-1-phosphate was shown to be a specific and potent inducer of arachidonic acid and prostanoid synthesis in cells through the translocation and activation of the cytoplasmic phospholipase A2.

Dacylglycerols are often found in bakery products, beverages, ice cream, chewing gum, shortening, whipped toppings, margarine, and confections. Synthesis of diacylglycerol begins with glycerol-3-phosphate, which is derived primarily from dihydroxyacetone phosphate, a product of glycolysis (usually in the cytoplasm of liver or adipose tissue cells). Glycerol-3-phosphate is first acylated with acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) to form lysophosphatidic acid, which is then acylated with another molecule of acyl-CoA to yield phosphatidic acid. Phosphatidic acid is then de-phosphorylated to form diacylglycerol.Diacylglycerols are precursors to triacylglycerols (triglyceride), which are formed by the addition of a third fatty acid to the diacylglycerol under the catalysis of diglyceride acyltransferase.

It is a monoglycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylcholine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. Lysophosphatidylcholines can have different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 (sn-1) position. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. LysoPC(22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of docosahexaenoic acid at the C-1 position. The docosahexaenoic acid moiety is derived from fish oils. Lysophosphatidylcholine is found in small amounts in most tissues. It is formed by hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by the enzyme phospholipase A2, as part of the de-acylation/re-acylation cycle that controls its overall molecular species composition. It can also be formed inadvertently during extraction of lipids from tissues if the phospholipase is activated by careless handling. In blood plasma significant amounts of lysophosphatidylcholine are formed by a specific enzyme system, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), which is secreted from the liver. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of the fatty acids of position sn-2 of phosphatidylcholine to the free cholesterol in plasma, with formation of cholesterol esters and lysophosphatidylcholine. Lysophospholipids have a role in lipid signaling by acting on lysophospholipid receptors (LPL-R). LPL-R's are members of the G protein-coupled receptor family of integral membrane proteins.

594.2312026_MZ	Taurocholic acid 3-sulfate	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Taurocholic acid 3-sulfate is a sulfated bile acid. It is a sulfate salt of taurocholic acid and is also known as cholaic acid, cholyltaurine, or acidum cholatauricum. Under normal circumstances, bile acid sulfation is a minor pathway. However in the presence of cholestasis, the fraction of the bile acid pool which is sulfated increases. Sulfation of bile acids increases the aqueous solubility of the amphipathic compounds and results in more efficient renal clearance as well as in decreased reabsorption from the intestinal lumen. Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in bile of mammals. The distinction between different bile acids is minute, depends only on presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g., membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues.

It is a sulfate salt of taurocholic acid and is also known as cholaic acid, cholyltaurine, or acidum cholatauricum. Under normal circumstances, bile acid sulfation is a minor pathway. However in the presence of cholestasis, the fraction of the bile acid pool which is sulfated increases. Sulfation of bile acids increases the aqueous solubility of the amphipathic compounds and results in more efficient renal clearance as well as in decreased reabsorption from the intestinal lumen. Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in bile of mammals. The distinction between different bile acids is minute, depends only on presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g., membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues.

Dacylglycerols are often found in bakery products, beverages, ice cream, chewing gum, shortening, whipped toppings, margarine, and confections. Synthesis of diacylglycerol begins with glycerol-3-phosphate, which is derived primarily from dihydroxyacetone phosphate, a product of glycolysis (usually in the cytoplasm of liver or adipose tissue cells). Glycerol-3-phosphate is first acylated with acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) to form lysophosphatidic acid, which is then acylated with another molecule of acyl-CoA to yield phosphatidic acid. Phosphatidic acid is then de-phosphorylated to form diacylglycerol. Diacylglycerols are precursors to triacylglycerols (triglyceride), which are formed by the addition of a third fatty acid to the diacylglycerol under the catalysis of diglyceride acyltransferase. Since diacylglycerols are synthesized via phosphatidic acid, they will usually contain a saturated fatty acid at the C-1 position on the glycerol moiety and an unsaturated fatty acid at the C-2 position.

606.4448064_MZ	LysoPhosphatidylcholine with formula C32H66NO7P	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	LysoPC(24:0) is a lysophospholipid (LyP). It is a monoglycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylcholine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. Lysophosphatidylcholines can have different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 (sn-1) position. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. LysoPC(24:0), in particular, consists of one chain of lignoceric acid at the C-1 position. The lignoceric acid moiety is derived from groundnut oil. Lysophosphatidylcholine is found in small amounts in most tissues. It is formed by hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by the enzyme phospholipase A2, as part of the de-acylation/re-acylation cycle that controls its overall molecular species composition. It can also be formed inadvertently during extraction of lipids from tissues if the phospholipase is activated by careless handling. In blood plasma significant amounts of lysophosphatidylcholine are formed by a specific enzyme system, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), which is secreted from the liver. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of the fatty acids of position sn-2 of phosphatidylcholine to the free cholesterol in plasma, with formation of cholesterol esters and lysophosphatidylcholine. Lysophospholipids have a role in lipid signaling by acting on lysophospholipid receptors (LPL-R). LPL-R's are members of the G protein-coupled receptor family of integral membrane proteins.

Dacylglycerols are often found in bakery products, beverages, ice cream, chewing gum, shortening, whipped toppings, margarine, and confections. Synthesis of diacylglycerol begins with glycerol-3-phosphate, which is derived primarily from dihydroxyacetone phosphate, a product of glycolysis (usually in the cytoplasm of liver or adipose tissue cells). Glycerol-3-phosphate is first acylated with acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) to form lysophosphatidic acid, which is then acylated with another molecule of acyl-CoA to yield phosphatidic acid. Phosphatidic acid is then de-phosphorylated to form diacylglycerol.Diacylglycerols are precursors to triacylglycerols (triglyceride), which are formed by the addition of a third fatty acid to the diacylglycerol under the catalysis of diglyceride acyltransferase. Since diacylglycerols are synthesized via phosphatidic acid, they will usually contain a saturated fatty acid at the C-1 position on the glycerol moiety and an unsaturated fatty acid at the C-2 position.

Immune mediated inflammatory neurological disorders like MS and GBS are characterized by demyelination and axonal damage. QYNAD can reversibly block voltage-gated sodium channels in a concentration-dependent manner. The blocking mechanism is a shift of the steady state inactivation curve of the sodium channels to more negative potentials, as with many local anaesthetics. QYNAD was found to reach concentrations in the CSF of MS or GBS that could subsantially block neuronal sodium channels. (PMID: 11750990).

Hesperidin is an abundant and inexpensive by-product of Citrus cultivation and is the major flavonoid in sweet orange and lemon. In young immature oranges it can account for up to 14% of the fresh weight of the fruit due to vitamin C deficiency such as bruising due to capillary fragility were found in early studies to be relieved by crude vitamin C extract but not by purified vitamin C. The bioflavonoids, formerly called vitamin P, were found to be the essential components in correcting this bruising tendency and improving the permeability and integrity of the capillary lining. These bioflavonoids include hesperidin, citrin, rutin, flavones, flavonols, catechin and quercetin. Of historical importance is the observation that citrin, a mixture of two flavonoids, eriodictyol and hesperidin, was considered to possess a vitamin-like activity, as early as in 1949. Hesperidin deficiency has since been linked with abnormal capillary leakiness as well as pain in the extremities causing aches, weakness and night leg cramps. Supplemental hesperidin also helps in reducing oedema or excess swelling in the legs due to fluid accumulation. As with other bioflavonoids, hesperidin works best when administered concomitantly with vitamin C. No signs of toxicity have been observed with normal intake of hesperidin. Hesperidin was first discovered in 1827, by Lebreton, but not in a pure state and has been under continuous investigation since then (PMID: 11746857).

Cholesterol esters are cholesterol molecules with long-chain fatty acids linked to the hydroxyl group. They are much less polar than free cholesterol and appear to be the preferred form for transport in plasma and for storage. Cholesterol esters do not contribute to membranes but are packed into intracellular lipid particles or lipoprotein particles. Because of the mechanism of synthesis, plasma cholesterol esters tend to contain relatively high proportions of C18 fatty acids. Cholesterol esters are major constituents of the adrenal glands and they also accumulate in the fatty lesions of atherosclerotic plaques. Cholesterol esters are also major constituents of the lipoprotein particles carried in blood (HDL, LDL, VLDL). The cholesterol esters in high-density lipoproteins (HDL) are synthesized largely by transfer of fatty acids to cholesterol from position sn-2 (or C-2) of phosphatidylcholine catalyzed by the enzyme lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT). The enzyme also promotes the transfer of cholesterol from cells to HDL. As cholesterol esters accumulate in the lipoprotein core, cholesterol is removed from its surface thus promoting the flow of cholesterol from cell membranes into HDL. This in turn leads to morphological changes in HDL, which grow and become spherical. Subsequently, cholesterol esters are transferred to the other lipoprotein fractions LDL and VLDL, a reaction catalyzed by cholesteryl ester transfer protein. Another enzyme, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) synthesizes cholesterol esters from CoA esters of fatty acids and cholesterol. Cholesterol ester hydrolases liberate cholesterol and free fatty acids when required for membrane and lipoprotein formation, and they also provide cholesterol for hormone synthesis in adrenal cells.

646.4941097_MZ	Phosphatidylethanolamine (14:0/P-16:0)	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	PE(14:0/P-16:0) is a phosphatidylethanolamine (PE or GPEtn). It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylethanolamine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. As is the case with diacylglycerols, glycerophosphoethanolamines can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PE(14:0/P-16:0), in particular, consists of one chain of myristic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of plasmalogen 16:0 at the C-2 position. The myristic acid moiety is derived from nutmeg and butter, while the plasmalogen 16:0 moiety is derived from animal fats, liver and kidney. Phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, as well as being involved in metabolism and signaling. While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PEs are neutral zwitterions at physiological pH. They mostly have palmitic or stearic acid on carbon 1 and a long chain unsaturated fatty acid (e.g. 18:2, 20:4 and 22:6) on carbon 2. PE synthesis can occur via two pathways. The first requires that ethanolamine be activated by phosphorylation and then coupled to CDP. The ethanolamine is then transferred from CDP-ethanolamine to phosphatidic acid to yield PE. The second involves the decarboxylation of PS. Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids. In animal tissues, the alkyl and alkenyl moieties in both non-polar and phospholipids tend to be rather simple in composition with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 (double bond in position 9) predominating. Ether analogues of triacylglycerols, i.e. 1-alkyldiacyl-sn-glycerols, are present at trace levels only if at all in most animal tissues, but they can be major components of some marine lipids.

Fatty acid esters of cholesterol constitute about two-thirds of the cholesterol in the plasma. Cholesterol is a sterol (a combination steroid and alcohol) and a lipid found in the cell membranes of all body tissues, and transported in the blood plasma of all animals. The accumulation of cholesterol esters in the arterial intima (the innermost layer of an artery, in direct contact with the flowing blood) is a characteristic feature of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a disease affecting arterial blood vessels. It is a chronic inflammatory response in the walls of arteries, in large part to the deposition of lipoproteins (plasma proteins that carry cholesterol and triglycerides). Cholesteryl linoleate is contained in low density lipoprotein and atherosclerotic lesions. The oxidation products of cholesteryl linoleate may cause chronic inflammatory processes.

The plasma membrane of cells is highly enriched in sphingomyelin and is considered largely to be found in the exoplasmic leaflet of the cell membrane. However, there is some evidence that there may also be a sphingomyelin pool in the inner leaflet of the membrane. Moreover, neutral sphingomyelinase-2 - an enzyme that breaks down sphingomyelin into ceramide has been found to localise exclusively to the inner leaflet further suggesting that there may be sphingomyelin present there. Sphingomyelin can accumulate in a rare hereditary disease called Niemann-Pick Disease, types A and B. Niemann-Pick disease is a genetically-inherited disease caused by a deficiency in the enzyme Sphingomyelinase, which causes the accumulation of Sphingomyelin in spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow, and the brain, causing irreversible neurological damage. SMs play a role in signal transduction. Sphingomyelins are synthesized by the transfer of phosphorylcholine from phosphatidylcholine to a ceramide in a reaction catalyzed by sphingomyelin synthase.

It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylethanolamine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. As is the case with diacylglycerols, glycerophosphoethanolamines can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PE(14:1(9Z)/14:1(9Z)), in particular, consists of two chains of myristoleic acid at the C-1 and C-2 positions. The myristoleic acid moieties are derived from milk fats. Phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, as well as being involved in metabolism and signaling.While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PEs are neutral zwitterions at physiological pH. They mostly have palmitic or stearic acid on carbon 1 and a long chain unsaturated fatty acid (e.g. 18:2, 20:4 and 22:6) on carbon 2. PE synthesis can occur via two pathways. The first requires that ethanolamine be activated by phosphorylation and then coupled to CDP. The ethanolamine is then transferred from CDP-ethanolamine to phosphatidic acid to yield PE. The second involves the decarboxylation of PS.

665.2139302_MZ	Glycogen	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Glycogen is a highly-branched polymer of about 30,000 glucose residues and has a molecular weight between 106 and 107 daltons (4.8 million approx.). Most of Glc units are linked by alpha-1,4 glycosidic bonds, approximately 1 in 12 Glc residues also makes -1,6 glycosidic bond with a second Glc which results in the creation of a branch. Glycogen only has one reducing end and a large number of non-reducing ends with a free hydroxyl group at carbon 4. The glycogen granules contain both glycogen and the enzymes of glycogen synthesis (glycogenesis) and degradation (glycogenolysis). The enzymes are nested between the outer branches of the glycogen molecules and act on the non-reducing ends. Therefore, the many non-reducing end-branches of glycogen facilitate its rapid synthesis and breakdown. In hypoglycemia caused by excessive insulin, liver glycogen levels are high, but the high insulin level prevents the glycogenolysis necessary to maintain normal blood sugar levels. Glucagon is a common treatment for this type of hypoglycemia. Glycogen is a polysaccharide that is the principal storage form of glucose (Glc) in animal and human cells. Glycogen is found in the form of granules in the cytosol in many cell types. Hepatocytes (liver cells) have the highest concentration of it - up to 8% of the fresh weight in well fed state, or 100 to 120 g in an adult - giving liver a distinctive, 'starchy taste'. In the muscles, glycogen is found in a much lower concentration (1% of the muscle mass), but the total amount exceeds that in liver. Small amounts of glycogen are found in the kidneys, and even smaller amounts in certain glial cells in the brain and white blood cells.

668.6337057_MZ	N-Lignoceroylsphingosine	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Ceramide (N-acyl sphingosine) is known as an important precursor common to the biosynthesis of glycosphingolipids and sphingomyelin. Naturally occurring ceramide is composed of various molecular species resulting from a combination of C16 and 26 fatty acids and sphingosine (sphingenine). The N-acyl chain is thought to be mainly introduced by the acylation of sphinganine, and the resultant dihydroceramide (N-acyl sphinganine) is desaturated to form ceramide. The hydrolysis of sphingolipids also yields ceramide and may further lead to the generation of sphingosine and sphingosine phosphate.

Ceramide, is thought to act as a second messenger in the intracellular signaling pathway to apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, cell differentiation, cell propagation, or induction of cytokine synthesis.

It is a glyceride consisting of two fatty acid chains covalently bonded to a glycerol molecule through ester linkages. Diacylglycerols can have many different combinations of fatty acids attached at both the C-1 and C-2 positions. DG(14:0/24:1(15Z)/0:0), in particular, consists of one chain of myristic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of nervonic acid at the C-2 position. The myristic acid moiety is derived from nutmeg and butter, while the nervonic acid moiety is derived from fish oils. Mono- and diacylglycerols are common food additives used to blend together certain ingredients, such as oil and water, which would not otherwise blend well. Dacylglycerols are often found in bakery products, beverages, ice cream, chewing gum, shortening, whipped toppings, margarine, and confections. Synthesis of diacylglycerol begins with glycerol-3-phosphate, which is derived primarily from dihydroxyacetone phosphate, a product of glycolysis (usually in the cytoplasm of liver or adipose tissue cells). Glycerol-3-phosphate is first acylated with acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) to form lysophosphatidic acid, which is then acylated with another molecule of acyl-CoA to yield phosphatidic acid. Phosphatidic acid is then de-phosphorylated to form diacylglycerol.Diacylglycerols are precursors to triacylglycerols (triglyceride), which are formed by the addition of a third fatty acid to the diacylglycerol under the catalysis of diglyceride acyltransferase. Since diacylglycerols are synthesized via phosphatidic acid, they will usually contain a saturated fatty acid at the C-1 position on the glycerol moiety and an unsaturated fatty acid at the C-2 position.

671.6156508_MZ	Cholesterol Ester with formula	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	CE(18:0) is a cholesterol fatty acid ester or simply a cholesterol ester (CE). Cholesterol esters are cholesterol molecules with long-chain fatty acids linked to the hydroxyl group. They are much less polar than free cholesterol and appear to be the preferred form for transport in plasma and for storage. Cholesterol esters do not contribute to membranes but are packed into intracellular lipid particles or lipoprotein particles. Because of the mechanism of synthesis, plasma cholesterol esters tend to contain relatively high proportions of C18 fatty acids. Cholesterol esters are major constituents of the adrenal glands and they also accumulate in the fatty lesions of atherosclerotic plaques. Cholesterol esters are also major constituents of the lipoprotein particles carried in blood (HDL, LDL, VLDL). The cholesterol esters in high-density lipoproteins (HDL) are synthesized largely by transfer of fatty acids to cholesterol from position sn-2 (or C-2) of phosphatidylcholine catalyzed by the enzyme lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT). The enzyme also promotes the transfer of cholesterol from cells to HDL. As cholesterol esters accumulate in the lipoprotein core, cholesterol is removed from its surface thus promoting the flow of cholesterol from cell membranes into HDL. This in turn leads to morphological changes in HDL, which grow and become spherical. Subsequently, cholesterol esters are transferred to the other lipoprotein fractions LDL and VLDL, a reaction catalyzed by cholesteryl ester transfer protein. Another enzyme, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) synthesizes cholesterol esters from CoA esters of fatty acids and cholesterol. Cholesterol ester hydrolases liberate cholesterol and free fatty acids when required for membrane and lipoprotein formation, and they also provide cholesterol for hormone synthesis in adrenal cells.

Ceramides are amides of fatty acids with long-chain di- or trihydroxy bases, the commonest in animals being sphingosine and in plants phytosphingosine. The acyl group of ceramides is generally a long-chain saturated or monounsaturated fatty acid. The most frequent fatty acids found in animal ceramides are 18:0, 24:0 and 24:1(n-9). Ceramide 1-phosphates are produced by phosphorylation of ceramide by a specific ceramide kinase. Ceramide-1-phosphate was shown to be a specific and potent inducer of arachidonic acid and prostanoid synthesis in cells through the translocation and activation of the cytoplasmic phospholipase A2.

As is the case with diacylglycerols, phosphatidic acids can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PA(16:0/18:1(11Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of palmitic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of vaccenic acid at the C-2 position. The palmitic acid moiety is derived from fish oils, milk fats, vegetable oils and animal fats, while the vaccenic acid moiety is derived from butter fat and animal fat. Phosphatidic acids are quite rare but are extremely important as intermediates in the biosynthesis of triacylglycerols and phospholipids. Indeed, the concentration of phosphatidic acids is often over-estimated in tissues and biofluids as it can arise by inadvertent enzymatic hydrolysis during inappropriate storage or extraction conditions during analysis. The main biosynthetic route of phosphatidic acid in animal tissues involves sequential acylation of alpha-glycerophosphate by acyl-CoA derivatives of fatty acids. PAs are biologically active lipids that can stimulate a large range of responses in many different cell types, such as platelet aggregation, smooth muscle contraction, in vivo vasoactive effects, chemotaxis, expression of adhesion molecules, increased tight junction permeability of endothelial cells, induction of stress fibres, modulation of cardiac contractility, and many others. Diacylglycerols (DAGs) can be converted to PAs by DAG kinases and indirect evidence supports the notion that PAs alter the excitability of neurons. Phospholipase Ds (PLDs), which catalyze the conversion of glycerolphospholipids, particularly phosphatidylcholine, to PAs and the conversion of N-arachidonoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE) to anandamide and PAs are activated by several inflammatory mediators including bradykinin, ATP and glutamate. PAs activate downstream signaling pathways such as PKCs and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which are linked to an increase in sensitivity of sensory neurons either during inflammation or in chronic pain models. Circumstantial evidence that PAs are converted to DAGs. (PMID: 12618218, 16185776).

It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylserine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. As is the case with diacylglycerols, glycerophosphoserines can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PS(14:1(9Z)/14:1(9Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of myristoleic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of myristoleic acid at the C-2 position. The myristoleic acid moiety is derived from milk fats, while the myristoleic acid moiety is derived from milk fats. Phosphatidylserine or 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine is distributed widely among animals, plants and microorganisms. It is usually less than 10% of the total phospholipids, the greatest concentration being in myelin from brain tissue. However, it may comprise 10 to 20 mol% of the total phospholipid in the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum of the cell. Phosphatidylserine is an acidic (anionic) phospholipid with three ionizable groups, i.e. the phosphate moiety, the amino group and the carboxyl function. As with other acidic lipids, it exists in nature in salt form, but it has a high propensity to chelate to calcium via the charged oxygen atoms of both the carboxyl and phosphate moieties, modifying the conformation of the polar head group. This interaction may be of considerable relevance to the biological function of phosphatidylserine, especially during bone formation for example. As phosphatidylserine is located entirely on the inner monolayer surface of the plasma membrane (and of other cellular membranes) and it is the most abundant anionic phospholipids. Therefore phosphatidylseriine may make the largest contribution to interfacial effects in membranes involving non-specific electrostatic interactions. This normal distribution is disturbed during platelet activation and cellular apoptosis. In human plasma, 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl and 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl species predominate, but in brain (especially grey matter), retina and many other tissues 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl species are very abundant. Indeed, the ratio of n-3 to n-6 fatty acids in brain phosphatidylserine is very much higher than in most other lipids. While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. Phosphatidylserines typically carry a net charge of -1 at physiological pH. They mostly have palmitic or stearic acid on carbon 1 and a long chain unsaturated fatty acid (e.g. 18:2, 20:4 and 22:6) on carbon 2. PS biosynthesis involves an exchange reaction of serine for ethanolamine in PE.

PEs are neutral zwitterions at physiological pH. They mostly have palmitic or stearic acid on carbon 1 and a long chain unsaturated fatty acid (e.g. 18:2, 20:4 and 22:6) on carbon 2. PE synthesis can occur via two pathways. The first requires that ethanolamine be activated by phosphorylation and then coupled to CDP. The ethanolamine is then transferred from CDP-ethanolamine to phosphatidic acid to yield PE. The second involves the decarboxylation of PS. Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids. In animal tissues, the alkyl and alkenyl moieties in both non-polar and phospholipids tend to be rather simple in composition with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 (double bond in position 9) predominating.

It is a glyceride consisting of two fatty acid chains covalently bonded to a glycerol molecule through ester linkages. Diacylglycerols can have many different combinations of fatty acids attached at both the C-1 and C-2 positions. DG(16:0/24:0/0:0), in particular, consists of one chain of palmitic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of lignoceric acid at the C-2 position. The palmitic acid moiety is derived from fish oils, milk fats, vegetable oils and animal fats, while the lignoceric acid moiety is derived from groundnut oil. Mono- and diacylglycerols are common food additives used to blend together certain ingredients, such as oil and water, which would not otherwise blend well. Dacylglycerols are often found in bakery products, beverages, ice cream, chewing gum, shortening, whipped toppings, margarine, and confections. Synthesis of diacylglycerol begins with glycerol-3-phosphate, which is derived primarily from dihydroxyacetone phosphate, a product of glycolysis (usually in the cytoplasm of liver or adipose tissue cells). Glycerol-3-phosphate is first acylated with acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) to form lysophosphatidic acid, which is then acylated with another molecule of acyl-CoA to yield phosphatidic acid. Phosphatidic acid is then de-phosphorylated to form diacylglycerol.Diacylglycerols are precursors to triacylglycerols (triglyceride), which are formed by the addition of a third fatty acid to the diacylglycerol under the catalysis of diglyceride acyltransferase. Since diacylglycerols are synthesized via phosphatidic acid, they will usually contain a saturated fatty acid at the C-1 position on the glycerol moiety and an unsaturated fatty acid at the C-2 position.

It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylethanolamine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. As is the case with diacylglycerols, glycerophosphoethanolamines can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PE(15:0/P-16:0), in particular, consists of one chain of pentadecanoic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of plasmalogen 16:0 at the C-2 position. The pentadecanoic acid moiety is derived from dairy products and milk fat, while the plasmalogen 16:0 moiety is derived from animal fats, liver and kidney. Phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, as well as being involved in metabolism and signaling. While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PEs are neutral zwitterions at physiological pH. They mostly have palmitic or stearic acid on carbon 1 and a long chain unsaturated fatty acid (e.g. 18:2, 20:4 and 22:6) on carbon 2. PE synthesis can occur via two pathways. The first requires that ethanolamine be activated by phosphorylation and then coupled to CDP. The ethanolamine is then transferred from CDP-ethanolamine to phosphatidic acid to yield PE. The second involves the decarboxylation of PS. Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids. In animal tissues, the alkyl and alkenyl moieties in both non-polar and phospholipids tend to be rather simple in composition with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 (double bond in position 9) predominating. Ether analogues of triacylglycerols, i.e. 1-alkyldiacyl-sn-glycerols, are present at trace levels only if at all in most animal tissues, but they can be major components of some marine lipids.

Diadenosine diphosphate is typically synthesized from ADP-ribosyl cyclases. Diadenosine polyphosphates are members of a group of dinucleoside polyphosphates that are ubiquitous, naturally occurring molecules. They form a recently identified class of compounds derived from ATP and consist of two adenosine molecules bridged by up to six phosphate groups. These compounds are stored in high concentrations in platelet dense granules and are released when platelets become activated. Some of the compounds promote platelet aggregation, while others are inhibitory. Possible roles as neurotransmitters, extracellular signalling molecules or 'alarmones' secreted by cells in response to physiologically stressful stimuli have been postulated. Recent studies suggest a role for these compounds in atrial and synaptic neurotransmission. Studies using isolated mesenteric arteries indicate an important role of phosphate chain length in determining whether diadenosine polyphosphates produce vasodilatation or vasoconstriction, but in the coronary circulation, diadenosine polyphosphates generally produce vasodilatation via mechanisms thought to involve release of NO or prostacyclin (PGI2). They produce cardiac electrophysiological effects by altering ventricular refractoriness at submicromolar concentrations and reduce heart rate. Mechanisms involving KATP channels have been proposed in addition to the involvement of P1- and P2-purinergic receptors and the specific diadenosine polyphosphate receptor identified on isolated cardiac myocytes. Clinical evidence suggests a role for diadenosine polyphosphates in hypertensive patients and those with the Chediak-Higashi syndrome. (PMID: 10434992).

Phosphatidylserine is an acidic (anionic) phospholipid with three ionizable groups, i.e. the phosphate moiety, the amino group and the carboxyl function. As with other acidic lipids, it exists in nature in salt form, but it has a high propensity to chelate to calcium via the charged oxygen atoms of both the carboxyl and phosphate moieties, modifying the conformation of the polar head group. This interaction may be of considerable relevance to the biological function of phosphatidylserine, especially during bone formation for example. As phosphatidylserine is located entirely on the inner monolayer surface of the plasma membrane (and of other cellular membranes) and it is the most abundant anionic phospholipids. Therefore phosphatidylseriine may make the largest contribution to interfacial effects in membranes involving non-specific electrostatic interactions. This normal distribution is disturbed during platelet activation and cellular apoptosis. In human plasma, 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl and 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl species predominate, but in brain (especially grey matter), retina and many other tissues 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl species are very abundant. Indeed, the ratio of n-3 to n-6 fatty acids in brain phosphatidylserine is very much higher than in most other lipids. While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. Phosphatidylserines typically carry a net charge of -1 at physiological pH. They mostly have palmitic or stearic acid on carbon 1 and a long chain unsaturated fatty acid (e.g. 18:2, 20:4 and 22:6) on carbon 2. PS biosynthesis involves an exchange reaction of serine for ethanolamine in PE.

It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylethanolamine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. As is the case with diacylglycerols, glycerophosphoethanolamines can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PE(16:1(9Z)/P-18:1(11Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of palmitoleic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of plasmalogen 18:1n7 at the C-2 position. The palmitoleic acid moiety is derived from animal fats and vegetable oils, while the plasmalogen 18:1n7 moiety is derived from animal fats, liver and kidney. Phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, as well as being involved in metabolism and signaling. While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PEs are neutral zwitterions at physiological pH. They mostly have palmitic or stearic acid on carbon 1 and a long chain unsaturated fatty acid (e.g. 18:2, 20:4 and 22:6) on carbon 2. PE synthesis can occur via two pathways. The first requires that ethanolamine be activated by phosphorylation and then coupled to CDP. The ethanolamine is then transferred from CDP-ethanolamine to phosphatidic acid to yield PE. The second involves the decarboxylation of PS. Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids. In animal tissues, the alkyl and alkenyl moieties in both non-polar and phospholipids tend to be rather simple in composition with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 (double bond in position 9) predominating. Ether analogues of triacylglycerols, i.e. 1-alkyldiacyl-sn-glycerols, are present at trace levels only if at all in most animal tissues, but they can be major components of some marine lipids.

698.5549652_MZ	Galactosylceramide (d18:1/16:0)	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Galactosylceramides (GalCer) are non-acidic monoglycosphingolipids, i.e. a sphingolipid with one carbohydrate moiety attached to a ceramide unit. They are an intermediate in sphingolipid metabolism and is the second to last step in the synthesis of digalactosylceramidesulfate. GalCer is generated from ceramide via the enzyme UDP-galactose ceramide galactosyltransferase [EC:2.4.1.47]. It can be converted to digalactosylceramide via the enzyme glycosyltransferases [EC 2.4.1.-]. Galactosylceramide is the principal glycosphingolipid in brain tissue, hence the trivial name cerebroside, which was first conferred on it in 1874. Galactosylceramides are found in all nervous tissues, but they can amount to 2% of the dry weight of grey matter and 12% of white matter. They are major constituents of oligodendrocytes. Synthesis of galactosylceramide takes place on the lumenal surface of the endoplasmic reticulum, although it has free access to the cytosolic surface by an energy-independent flip-flop process. GalCer sits in the extracellular leaflet of cell membranes in nanometer sized domains or rafts. The local clustering of GalCer within rafts is thought to facilitate the initial adhesion of certain viruses, including HIV-1 and bacteria to cells through multivalent interactions between receptor proteins and GalCer. A defect in the degradation of cerbrosides leads to a disorder called Krabbe disease. Krabbe disease (also known as globoid cell leukodystrophy or galactosylceramide lipidosis) is a rare, often fatal degenerative disorder that affects the myelin sheath of the nervous system. Krabbe disease is caused by mutations in the GALC gene, which causes a deficiency of galactosylceramidase. Infants with Krabbe disease are normal at birth. Symptoms begin between the ages of 3 and 6 months with irritability, fevers, limb stiffness, seizures, feeding difficulties, vomiting, and slowing of mental and motor development. There are also juvenile- and adult-onset cases of Krabbe disease, which have similar symptoms but slower progression. In infants, the disease is generally fatal before age 2. Patients with late-onset Krabbe disease tend to have a slower progression of the disease and live significantly longer.Cerebrosides are glycosphingolipids. There are four types of glycosphingolipids, the cerebrosides, sulfatides, globosides and gangliosides. Cerebrosides have a single sugar group linked to ceramide. The most common are galactocerebrosides (containing galactose), the least common are glucocerebrosides (containing glucose). Galactocerebrosides are found predominantly in neuronal cell membranes. In contrast glucocerebrosides are not normally found in membranes. Instead, they are typically intermediates in the synthesis or degradation of more complex glycosphingolipids. Galactocerebrosides are synthesized from ceramide and UDP-galactose. Excess lysosomal accumulation of glucocerebrosides is found in Gaucher disease.

Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PA(18:0/18:2(9Z,12Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of stearic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of linoleic acid at the C-2 position. The stearic acid moiety is derived from animal fats, coco butter and sesame oil, while the linoleic acid moiety is derived from seed oils. Phosphatidic acids are quite rare but are extremely important as intermediates in the biosynthesis of triacylglycerols and phospholipids. Indeed, the concentration of phosphatidic acids is often over-estimated in tissues and biofluids as it can arise by inadvertent enzymatic hydrolysis during inappropriate storage or extraction conditions during analysis. The main biosynthetic route of phosphatidic acid in animal tissues involves sequential acylation of alpha-glycerophosphate by acyl-CoA derivatives of fatty acids. PAs are biologically active lipids that can stimulate a large range of responses in many different cell types, such as platelet aggregation, smooth muscle contraction, in vivo vasoactive effects, chemotaxis, expression of adhesion molecules, increased tight junction permeability of endothelial cells, induction of stress fibres, modulation of cardiac contractility, and many others. Diacylglycerols (DAGs) can be converted to PAs by DAG kinases and indirect evidence supports the notion that PAs alter the excitability of neurons. Phospholipase Ds (PLDs), which catalyze the conversion of glycerolphospholipids, particularly phosphatidylcholine, to PAs and the conversion of N-arachidonoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE) to anandamide and PAs are activated by several inflammatory mediators including bradykinin, ATP and glutamate. PAs activate downstream signaling pathways such as PKCs and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which are linked to an increase in sensitivity of sensory neurons either during inflammation or in chronic pain models. Circumstantial evidence that PAs are converted to DAGs. (PMID: 12618218, 16185776).

699.6447756_MZ	Cholesterol Ester (20:0)	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	CE(20:0) is a cholesterol fatty acid ester or simply a cholesterol ester (CE). Cholesterol esters are cholesterol molecules with long-chain fatty acids linked to the hydroxyl group. They are much less polar than free cholesterol and appear to be the preferred form for transport in plasma and for storage. Cholesterol esters do not contribute to membranes but are packed into intracellular lipid particles or lipoprotein particles. Because of the mechanism of synthesis, plasma cholesterol esters tend to contain relatively high proportions of C18 fatty acids. Cholesterol esters are major constituents of the adrenal glands and they also accumulate in the fatty lesions of atherosclerotic plaques. Cholesterol esters are also major constituents of the lipoprotein particles carried in blood (HDL, LDL, VLDL). The cholesterol esters in high-density lipoproteins (HDL) are synthesized largely by transfer of fatty acids to cholesterol from position sn-2 (or C-2) of phosphatidylcholine catalyzed by the enzyme lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT). The enzyme also promotes the transfer of cholesterol from cells to HDL. As cholesterol esters accumulate in the lipoprotein core, cholesterol is removed from its surface thus promoting the flow of cholesterol from cell membranes into HDL. This in turn leads to morphological changes in HDL, which grow and become spherical. Subsequently, cholesterol esters are transferred to the other lipoprotein fractions LDL and VLDL, a reaction catalyzed by cholesteryl ester transfer protein. Another enzyme, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) synthesizes cholesterol esters from CoA esters of fatty acids and cholesterol. Cholesterol ester hydrolases liberate cholesterol and free fatty acids when required for membrane and lipoprotein formation, and they also provide cholesterol for hormone synthesis in adrenal cells.

The vaccenic acid moiety is derived from butter fat and animal fat, while the nervonic acid moiety is derived from fish oils. Mono- and diacylglycerols are common food additives used to blend together certain ingredients, such as oil and water, which would not otherwise blend well. Dacylglycerols are often found in bakery products, beverages, ice cream, chewing gum, shortening, whipped toppings, margarine, and confections. Synthesis of diacylglycerol begins with glycerol-3-phosphate, which is derived primarily from dihydroxyacetone phosphate, a product of glycolysis (usually in the cytoplasm of liver or adipose tissue cells). Glycerol-3-phosphate is first acylated with acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) to form lysophosphatidic acid, which is then acylated with another molecule of acyl-CoA to yield phosphatidic acid. Phosphatidic acid is then de-phosphorylated to form diacylglycerol.Diacylglycerols are precursors to triacylglycerols (triglyceride), which are formed by the addition of a third fatty acid to the diacylglycerol under the catalysis of diglyceride acyltransferase. Since diacylglycerols are synthesized via phosphatidic acid, they will usually contain a saturated fatty acid at the C-1 position on the glycerol moiety and an unsaturated fatty acid at the C-2 position.

The myristic acid moiety is derived from nutmeg and butter, while the mead acid moiety is derived from fish oils, liver and kidney. Phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, as well as being involved in metabolism and signaling.While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PEs are neutral zwitterions at physiological pH. They mostly have palmitic or stearic acid on carbon 1 and a long chain unsaturated fatty acid (e.g. 18:2, 20:4 and 22:6) on carbon 2. PE synthesis can occur via two pathways. The first requires that ethanolamine be activated by phosphorylation and then coupled to CDP. The ethanolamine is then transferred from CDP-ethanolamine to phosphatidic acid to yield PE. The second involves the decarboxylation of PS.

It is a glyceride consisting of two fatty acid chains covalently bonded to a glycerol molecule through ester linkages. Diacylglycerols can have many different combinations of fatty acids attached at both the C-1 and C-2 positions. DG(20:1(11Z)/22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)/0:0), in particular, consists of one chain of eicosenoic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of docosahexaenoic acid at the C-2 position. The eicosenoic acid moiety is derived from vegetable oils and cod oils, while the docosahexaenoic acid moiety is derived from fish oils. Mono- and diacylglycerols are common food additives used to blend together certain ingredients, such as oil and water, which would not otherwise blend well. Dacylglycerols are often found in bakery products, beverages, ice cream, chewing gum, shortening, whipped toppings, margarine, and confections. Synthesis of diacylglycerol begins with glycerol-3-phosphate, which is derived primarily from dihydroxyacetone phosphate, a product of glycolysis (usually in the cytoplasm of liver or adipose tissue cells). Glycerol-3-phosphate is first acylated with acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) to form lysophosphatidic acid, which is then acylated with another molecule of acyl-CoA to yield phosphatidic acid. Phosphatidic acid is then de-phosphorylated to form diacylglycerol.Diacylglycerols are precursors to triacylglycerols (triglyceride), which are formed by the addition of a third fatty acid to the diacylglycerol under the catalysis of diglyceride acyltransferase. Since diacylglycerols are synthesized via phosphatidic acid, they will usually contain a saturated fatty acid at the C-1 position on the glycerol moiety and an unsaturated fatty acid at the C-2 position.

Cholesterol esters are cholesterol molecules with long-chain fatty acids linked to the hydroxyl group. They are much less polar than free cholesterol and appear to be the preferred form for transport in plasma and for storage. Cholesterol esters do not contribute to membranes but are packed into intracellular lipid particles or lipoprotein particles. Because of the mechanism of synthesis, plasma cholesterol esters tend to contain relatively high proportions of C18 fatty acids. Cholesterol esters are major constituents of the adrenal glands and they also accumulate in the fatty lesions of atherosclerotic plaques. Cholesterol esters are also major constituents of the lipoprotein particles carried in blood (HDL, LDL, VLDL). The cholesterol esters in high-density lipoproteins (HDL) are synthesized largely by transfer of fatty acids to cholesterol from position sn-2 (or C-2) of phosphatidylcholine catalyzed by the enzyme lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT). The enzyme also promotes the transfer of cholesterol from cells to HDL. As cholesterol esters accumulate in the lipoprotein core, cholesterol is removed from its surface thus promoting the flow of cholesterol from cell membranes into HDL. This in turn leads to morphological changes in HDL, which grow and become spherical. Subsequently, cholesterol esters are transferred to the other lipoprotein fractions LDL and VLDL, a reaction catalyzed by cholesteryl ester transfer protein. Another enzyme, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) synthesizes cholesterol esters from CoA esters of fatty acids and cholesterol. Cholesterol ester hydrolases liberate cholesterol and free fatty acids when required for membrane and lipoprotein formation, and they also provide cholesterol for hormone synthesis in adrenal cells.

Fatty acid esters of cholesterol constitute about two-thirds of the cholesterol in the plasma. Cholesterol is a sterol (a combination steroid and alcohol) and a lipid found in the cell membranes of all body tissues, and transported in the blood plasma of all animals. The accumulation of cholesterol esters in the arterial intima (the innermost layer of an artery, in direct contact with the flowing blood) is a characteristic feature of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a disease affecting arterial blood vessels. It is a chronic inflammatory response in the walls of arteries, in large part to the deposition of lipoproteins (plasma proteins that carry cholesterol and triglycerides). Docosatetraenoic acid is one of the main polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) present in the brain, a lipid-rich organ containing mostly complex polar phospholipids, sphingolipids, gangliosides and cholesterol. Cholesteryl docosatetraenoic acid has been found in triglycerides-rich cells such as monocyte-derived macrophages. Docosatetraenoic acid is increased in plasma in children with protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM). (PMID: 17392137, 10424250, 9162758).

They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids. In animal tissues, the alkyl and alkenyl moieties in both non-polar and phospholipids tend to be rather simple in composition with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 (double bond in position 9) predominating. Ether analogues of triacylglycerols, i.e. 1-alkyldiacyl-sn-glycerols, are present at trace levels only if at all in most animal tissues, but they can be major components of some marine lipids.

In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids. In animal tissues, the alkyl and alkenyl moieties in both non-polar and phospholipids tend to be rather simple in composition with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 (double bond in position 9) predominating. Ether analogues of triacylglycerols, i.e. 1-alkyldiacyl-sn-glycerols, are present at trace levels only if at all in most animal tissues, but they can be major components of some marine lipids.

729.5819173_MZ	Ubiquinol 8	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Ubiquinol 8 is a ubiquinol in which the polyprenyl substituent is octaprenyl. Ubiquinol-8 is the reduced form of Ubiquinone-8. Ubiquinone (also known as coenzyme Q) is an isoprenoid quinone that functions as an electron carrier in membranes. In eukaryotes ubiquinone is found mostly within the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it functions in respiratory electron transport, transferring two electrons from either complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) or complex II (succinate-ubiquinone reductase) to complex III (bc1 complex). The quinone nucleus of ubiquinone is derived directly from 4-hydroxybenzoate, while the isoprenoid subunits of the polyisoprenoid tail are synthesized via the methylerythritol phosphate pathway, which feeds isoprene units into the Polyprenyl Biosynthesis pathways. The number of isoprenoid subunits in the ubiquinone side chain vary in different species. For example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has 6 such subunits, Escherichia coli K-12 has 8, rat and mouse have 9, and Homo sapiens has 10. Ubiquinol-8 is effective as an anti-oxidant. By donating one of its hydrogen atoms to become the free-radical semiquinone (.Q-), it can neutralize a lipid peroxyl radical. The free-radical semiquinone is then restored to a non-free-radical state by the respiratory chain Q cycle. ubiquinol or the free-radical semiquinone can also regenerate the Vitamin E tocopheroxyl radical by electron donation (http://www.benbest.com/nutrceut/CoEnzymeQ.html).

It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylserine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. As is the case with diacylglycerols, glycerophosphoserines can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PS(14:0/18:2(9Z,12Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of myristic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of linoleic acid at the C-2 position. The myristic acid moiety is derived from nutmeg and butter, while the linoleic acid moiety is derived from seed oils. Phosphatidylserine or 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine is distributed widely among animals, plants and microorganisms. It is usually less than 10% of the total phospholipids, the greatest concentration being in myelin from brain tissue. However, it may comprise 10 to 20 mol% of the total phospholipid in the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum of the cell. Phosphatidylserine is an acidic (anionic) phospholipid with three ionizable groups, i.e. the phosphate moiety, the amino group and the carboxyl function. As with other acidic lipids, it exists in nature in salt form, but it has a high propensity to chelate to calcium via the charged oxygen atoms of both the carboxyl and phosphate moieties, modifying the conformation of the polar head group. This interaction may be of considerable relevance to the biological function of phosphatidylserine, especially during bone formation for example. As phosphatidylserine is located entirely on the inner monolayer surface of the plasma membrane (and of other cellular membranes) and it is the most abundant anionic phospholipids. Therefore phosphatidylseriine may make the largest contribution to interfacial effects in membranes involving non-specific electrostatic interactions. This normal distribution is disturbed during platelet activation and cellular apoptosis. In human plasma, 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl and 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl species predominate, but in brain (especially grey matter), retina and many other tissues 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl species are very abundant. Indeed, the ratio of n-3 to n-6 fatty acids in brain phosphatidylserine is very much higher than in most other lipids. While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. Phosphatidylserines typically carry a net charge of -1 at physiological pH. They mostly have palmitic or stearic acid on carbon 1 and a long chain unsaturated fatty acid (e.g. 18:2, 20:4 and 22:6) on carbon 2. PS biosynthesis involves an exchange reaction of serine for ethanolamine in PE.

It usually consists of phosphorylcholine and ceramide. In humans, sphingomyelin is the only membrane phospholipid not derived from glycerol. Like all sphingolipids, SPH has a ceramide core (sphingosine bonded to a fatty acid via an amide linkage). In addition it contains one polar head group, which is either phosphocholine or phosphoethanolamine. The plasma membrane of cells is highly enriched in sphingomyelin and is considered largely to be found in the exoplasmic leaflet of the cell membrane. However, there is some evidence that there may also be a sphingomyelin pool in the inner leaflet of the membrane. Moreover, neutral sphingomyelinase-2 - an enzyme that breaks down sphingomyelin into ceramide has been found to localise exclusively to the inner leaflet further suggesting that there may be sphingomyelin present there. Sphingomyelin can accumulate in a rare hereditary disease called Niemann-Pick Disease, types A and B. Niemann-Pick disease is a genetically-inherited disease caused by a deficiency in the enzyme Sphingomyelinase, which causes the accumulation of Sphingomyelin in spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow, and the brain, causing irreversible neurological damage. SMs play a role in signal transduction. Sphingomyelins are synthesized by the transfer of phosphorylcholine from phosphatidylcholine to a ceramide in a reaction catalyzed by sphingomyelin synthase.

It is a glyceride consisting of two fatty acid chains covalently bonded to a glycerol molecule through ester linkages. Diacylglycerols can have many different combinations of fatty acids attached at both the C-1 and C-2 positions. DG(22:4(7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)/22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)/0:0), in particular, consists of one chain of adrenic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of docosahexaenoic acid at the C-2 position. The adrenic acid moiety is derived from animal fats, while the docosahexaenoic acid moiety is derived from fish oils. Mono- and diacylglycerols are common food additives used to blend together certain ingredients, such as oil and water, which would not otherwise blend well. Dacylglycerols are often found in bakery products, beverages, ice cream, chewing gum, shortening, whipped toppings, margarine, and confections. Synthesis of diacylglycerol begins with glycerol-3-phosphate, which is derived primarily from dihydroxyacetone phosphate, a product of glycolysis (usually in the cytoplasm of liver or adipose tissue cells). Glycerol-3-phosphate is first acylated with acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) to form lysophosphatidic acid, which is then acylated with another molecule of acyl-CoA to yield phosphatidic acid. Phosphatidic acid is then de-phosphorylated to form diacylglycerol.Diacylglycerols are precursors to triacylglycerols (triglyceride), which are formed by the addition of a third fatty acid to the diacylglycerol under the catalysis of diglyceride acyltransferase. Since diacylglycerols are synthesized via phosphatidic acid, they will usually contain a saturated fatty acid at the C-1 position on the glycerol moiety and an unsaturated fatty acid at the C-2 position.

The palmitic acid moiety is derived from fish oils, milk fats, vegetable oils and animal fats, while the linoleic acid moiety is derived from seed oils. Phosphatidylglycerol is present at a level of 1-2% in most animal tissues, but it can be the second most abundant phospholipid in lung surfactant at up to 11% of the total. It is well established that the concentration of phosphatidylglycerol increases during fetal development. Phosphatidylglycerol may be present in animal tissues merely as a precursor for diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin). Phosphatidylglycerol is formed from phosphatidic acid by a sequence of enzymatic reactions that proceeds via the intermediate, cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-diacylglycerol). Bioynthesis proceeds by condensation of phosphatidic acid and cytidine triphosphate with elimination of pyrophosphate via the action of phosphatidate cytidyltransferase (or CDP-synthase). CDP-diacylglycerol then reacts with glycerol-3-phosphate via phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase to form 3-sn-phosphatidyl-1'-sn-glycerol 3'-phosphoric acid, with the release of cytidine monophosphate (CMP). Finally, phosphatidylglycerol is formed by the action of specific phosphatases. While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PGs have a net charge of -1 at physiological pH and are found in high concentration in mitochondrial membranes and as components of pulmonary surfactant. PG also serves as a precursor for the synthesis of cardiolipin. PG is synthesized from CDP-diacylglycerol and glycerol-3-phosphate.

They are an intermediate in sphingolipid metabolism and is the second to last step in the synthesis of digalactosylceramidesulfate. GalCer is generated from ceramide via the enzyme UDP-galactose ceramide galactosyltransferase [EC:2.4.1.47]. It can be converted to digalactosylceramide via the enzyme glycosyltransferases [EC 2.4.1.-]. Galactosylceramide is the principal glycosphingolipid in brain tissue, hence the trivial name cerebroside, which was first conferred on it in 1874. Galactosylceramides are found in all nervous tissues, but they can amount to 2% of the dry weight of grey matter and 12% of white matter. They are major constituents of oligodendrocytes. Synthesis of galactosylceramide takes place on the lumenal surface of the endoplasmic reticulum, although it has free access to the cytosolic surface by an energy-independent flip-flop process. GalCer sits in the extracellular leaflet of cell membranes in nanometer sized domains or rafts. The local clustering of GalCer within rafts is thought to facilitate the initial adhesion of certain viruses, including HIV-1 and bacteria to cells through multivalent interactions between receptor proteins and GalCer. A defect in the degradation of cerbrosides leads to a disorder called Krabbe disease. Krabbe disease (also known as globoid cell leukodystrophy or galactosylceramide lipidosis) is a rare, often fatal degenerative disorder that affects the myelin sheath of the nervous system. Krabbe disease is caused by mutations in the GALC gene, which causes a deficiency of galactosylceramidase. Infants with Krabbe disease are normal at birth. Symptoms begin between the ages of 3 and 6 months with irritability, fevers, limb stiffness, seizures, feeding difficulties, vomiting, and slowing of mental and motor development. There are also juvenile- and adult-onset cases of Krabbe disease, which have similar symptoms but slower progression. In infants, the disease is generally fatal before age 2. Patients with late-onset Krabbe disease tend to have a slower progression of the disease and live significantly longer.Cerebrosides are glycosphingolipids. There are four types of glycosphingolipids, the cerebrosides, sulfatides, globosides and gangliosides. Cerebrosides have a single sugar group linked to ceramide. The most common are galactocerebrosides (containing galactose), the least common are glucocerebrosides (containing glucose). Galactocerebrosides are found predominantly in neuronal cell membranes. In contrast glucocerebrosides are not normally found in membranes. Instead, they are typically intermediates in the synthesis or degradation of more complex glycosphingolipids. Galactocerebrosides are synthesized from ceramide and UDP-galactose. Excess lysosomal accumulation of glucocerebrosides is found in Gaucher disease.

It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylserine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. As is the case with diacylglycerols, glycerophosphoserines can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PS(14:0/18:3(9Z,12Z,15Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of myristic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of a-linolenic acid at the C-2 position. The myristic acid moiety is derived from nutmeg and butter, while the a-linolenic acid moiety is derived from seed oils, especially canola and soybean oil. Phosphatidylserine or 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine is distributed widely among animals, plants and microorganisms. It is usually less than 10% of the total phospholipids, the greatest concentration being in myelin from brain tissue. However, it may comprise 10 to 20 mol% of the total phospholipid in the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum of the cell. Phosphatidylserine is an acidic (anionic) phospholipid with three ionizable groups, i.e. the phosphate moiety, the amino group and the carboxyl function. As with other acidic lipids, it exists in nature in salt form, but it has a high propensity to chelate to calcium via the charged oxygen atoms of both the carboxyl and phosphate moieties, modifying the conformation of the polar head group. This interaction may be of considerable relevance to the biological function of phosphatidylserine, especially during bone formation for example. As phosphatidylserine is located entirely on the inner monolayer surface of the plasma membrane (and of other cellular membranes) and it is the most abundant anionic phospholipids. Therefore phosphatidylseriine may make the largest contribution to interfacial effects in membranes involving non-specific electrostatic interactions. This normal distribution is disturbed during platelet activation and cellular apoptosis. In human plasma, 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl and 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl species predominate, but in brain (especially grey matter), retina and many other tissues 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl species are very abundant. Indeed, the ratio of n-3 to n-6 fatty acids in brain phosphatidylserine is very much higher than in most other lipids. While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. Phosphatidylserines typically carry a net charge of -1 at physiological pH. They mostly have palmitic or stearic acid on carbon 1 and a long chain unsaturated fatty acid (e.g. 18:2, 20:4 and 22:6) on carbon 2.

This lipid occurs in membranes of various cell types, but is found in particularly high concentrations in myelin where it constitutes 3-4% of total membrane lipids. This lipid is synthesized primarily in the oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. Accumulation of this lipid in the lysosomes is a characteristic of metachromatic leukodystrophy, a lysosomal storage disease caused by the deficiency of arylsulfatase A. Alterations in sulfatide metabolism, trafficking, and homeostasis are present in the earliest clinically recognizable stages of Alzheimer's disease.Cerebrosides are glycosphingolipids. There are four types of glycosphingolipids, the cerebrosides, sulfatides, globosides and gangliosides. Cerebrosides have a single sugar group linked to ceramide. The most common are galactocerebrosides (containing galactose), the least common are glucocerebrosides (containing glucose). Galactocerebrosides are found predominantly in neuronal cell membranes. In contrast glucocerebrosides are not normally found in membranes. Instead, they are typically intermediates in the synthesis or degradation of more complex glycosphingolipids. Galactocerebrosides are synthesized from ceramide and UDP-galactose. Excess lysosomal accumulation of glucocerebrosides is found in Gaucher disease. Sulfatides are glycosphingolipids. There are four types of glycosphingolipids, the cerebrosides, sulfatides, globosides and gangliosides. Sulfatides are the sulfuric acid esters of galactocerebrosides. They are synthesized from galactocerebrosides and activated sulfate, 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS).

Phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, as well as being involved in metabolism and signaling.

PEs are neutral zwitterions at physiological pH. They mostly have palmitic or stearic acid on carbon 1 and a long chain unsaturated fatty acid (e.g. 18:2, 20:4 and 22:6) on carbon 2. PE synthesis can occur via two pathways. The first requires that ethanolamine be activated by phosphorylation and then coupled to CDP. The ethanolamine is then transferred from CDP-ethanolamine to phosphatidic acid to yield PE. The second involves the decarboxylation of PS. Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids. In animal tissues, the alkyl and alkenyl moieties in both non-polar and phospholipids tend to be rather simple in composition with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 (double bond in position 9) predominating. Ether analogues of triacylglycerols, i.e. 1-alkyldiacyl-sn-glycerols, are present at trace levels only if at all in most animal tissues, but they can be major components of some marine lipids.

It is usually less than 10% of the total phospholipids, the greatest concentration being in myelin from brain tissue. However, it may comprise 10 to 20 mol% of the total phospholipid in the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum of the cell. Phosphatidylserine is an acidic (anionic) phospholipid with three ionizable groups, i.e. the phosphate moiety, the amino group and the carboxyl function. As with other acidic lipids, it exists in nature in salt form, but it has a high propensity to chelate to calcium via the charged oxygen atoms of both the carboxyl and phosphate moieties, modifying the conformation of the polar head group. This interaction may be of considerable relevance to the biological function of phosphatidylserine, especially during bone formation for example. As phosphatidylserine is located entirely on the inner monolayer surface of the plasma membrane (and of other cellular membranes) and it is the most abundant anionic phospholipids. Therefore phosphatidylseriine may make the largest contribution to interfacial effects in membranes involving non-specific electrostatic interactions.

It is a glyceride consisting of two fatty acid chains covalently bonded to a glycerol molecule through ester linkages. Diacylglycerols can have many different combinations of fatty acids attached at both the C-1 and C-2 positions. DG(20:0/24:1(15Z)/0:0), in particular, consists of one chain of arachidic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of nervonic acid at the C-2 position. The arachidic acid moiety is derived from peanut oil, while the nervonic acid moiety is derived from fish oils. Mono- and diacylglycerols are common food additives used to blend together certain ingredients, such as oil and water, which would not otherwise blend well. Dacylglycerols are often found in bakery products, beverages, ice cream, chewing gum, shortening, whipped toppings, margarine, and confections. Synthesis of diacylglycerol begins with glycerol-3-phosphate, which is derived primarily from dihydroxyacetone phosphate, a product of glycolysis (usually in the cytoplasm of liver or adipose tissue cells). Glycerol-3-phosphate is first acylated with acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) to form lysophosphatidic acid, which is then acylated with another molecule of acyl-CoA to yield phosphatidic acid. Phosphatidic acid is then de-phosphorylated to form diacylglycerol.Diacylglycerols are precursors to triacylglycerols (triglyceride), which are formed by the addition of a third fatty acid to the diacylglycerol under the catalysis of diglyceride acyltransferase. Since diacylglycerols are synthesized via phosphatidic acid, they will usually contain a saturated fatty acid at the C-1 position on the glycerol moiety and an unsaturated fatty acid at the C-2 position.

PCs can be synthesized via three different routes. In one route, choline is activated first by phosphorylation and then by coupling to CDP prior to attachment to phosphatidic acid. PCs can also synthesized by the addition of choline to CDP-activated 1,2-diacylglycerol. A third route to PC synthesis involves the conversion of either PS or PE to PC.

It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylserine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. As is the case with diacylglycerols, glycerophosphoserines can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PS(16:0/18:2(9Z,12Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of palmitic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of linoleic acid at the C-2 position. The palmitic acid moiety is derived from fish oils, milk fats, vegetable oils and animal fats, while the linoleic acid moiety is derived from seed oils. Phosphatidylserine or 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine is distributed widely among animals, plants and microorganisms. It is usually less than 10% of the total phospholipids, the greatest concentration being in myelin from brain tissue. However, it may comprise 10 to 20 mol% of the total phospholipid in the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum of the cell. Phosphatidylserine is an acidic (anionic) phospholipid with three ionizable groups, i.e. the phosphate moiety, the amino group and the carboxyl function. As with other acidic lipids, it exists in nature in salt form, but it has a high propensity to chelate to calcium via the charged oxygen atoms of both the carboxyl and phosphate moieties, modifying the conformation of the polar head group. This interaction may be of considerable relevance to the biological function of phosphatidylserine, especially during bone formation for example. As phosphatidylserine is located entirely on the inner monolayer surface of the plasma membrane (and of other cellular membranes) and it is the most abundant anionic phospholipids. Therefore phosphatidylseriine may make the largest contribution to interfacial effects in membranes involving non-specific electrostatic interactions. This normal distribution is disturbed during platelet activation and cellular apoptosis. In human plasma, 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl and 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl species predominate, but in brain (especially grey matter), retina and many other tissues 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl species are very abundant. Indeed, the ratio of n-3 to n-6 fatty acids in brain phosphatidylserine is very much higher than in most other lipids. While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. Phosphatidylserines typically carry a net charge of -1 at physiological pH. They mostly have palmitic or stearic acid on carbon 1 and a long chain unsaturated fatty acid (e.g. 18:2, 20:4 and 22:6) on carbon 2. PS biosynthesis involves an exchange reaction of serine for ethanolamine in PE.

Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PE(20:0/dm18:0), in particular, consists of one chain of arachidic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of plasmalogen 18:0 at the C-2 position. The arachidic acid moiety is derived from peanut oil, while the plasmalogen 18:0 moiety is derived from animal fats, liver and kidney. Phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, as well as being involved in metabolism and signaling.While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PEs are neutral zwitterions at physiological pH. They mostly have palmitic or stearic acid on carbon 1 and a long chain unsaturated fatty acid (e.g. 18:2, 20:4 and 22:6) on carbon 2. PE synthesis can occur via two pathways. The first requires that ethanolamine be activated by phosphorylation and then coupled to CDP. The ethanolamine is then transferred from CDP-ethanolamine to phosphatidic acid to yield PE. The second involves the decarboxylation of PS.Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids. In animal tissues, the alkyl and alkenyl moieties in both non-polar and phospholipids tend to be rather simple in composition with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 (double bond in position 9) predominating. Ether analogues of triacylglycerols, i.e. 1-alkyldiacyl-sn-glycerols, are present at trace levels only if at all in most animal tissues, but they can be major components of some marine lipids.

761.2250758_MZ	Troxerutin	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Troxerutin is a rutoside, a naturally occurring flavonoid. Flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds that are present in most fruits and vegetables. Although flavonoids are devoid of classical nutritional value, they are increasingly viewed as beneficial dietary components that act as potential protectors against human diseases such as coronary heart disease, cancers, and inflammatory bowel disease. Troxerutin is a beneficial cofactor in coumarin preparations used for the therapy of chronic venous insufficiency, since has hepatoprotective properties and thus protects the liver from a possible lipid peroxidation caused by coumarin. Oxidative stress might be involved in the upregulation of retinal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) during early diabetes, and it is likely that troxerutin has comparatively effective antioxidant properties; therefore, troxerutin might be a useful treatment for attenuating diabetic retinopathy. Troxerutin offers protection against gamma-radiation-induced micronuclei formation and DNA strand breaks and enhances repair of radiation-induced DNA strand breaks, in addition to anti-erythrocytic, anti-thrombic, fibrinolytic and oedema-protective rheological activity.

766.1041507_MZ	Coenzyme A	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Coenzyme A (CoA, CoASH, or HSCoA) is a coenzyme, notable for its role in the synthesis and oxidization of fatty acids, and the oxidation of pyruvate in the citric acid cycle. It is adapted from beta-mercaptoethylamine, panthothenate and adenosine triphosphate. Coenzyme A is synthesized in a five-step process from pantothenate and cysteine. In the first step Pantothenate (vitamin B5) is phosphorylated to 4'-phosphopantothenate by the enzyme pantothenate kinase (PanK; CoaA; CoaX)In the second step, a cysteine is added to 4'-phosphopantothenate by the enzyme phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase (PPC-DC; CoaB) to form 4'-phospho-N-pantothenoylcysteine (PPC). In the third step, PPC is decarboxylated to 4'-phosphopantetheine by phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase (CoaC). In the fourth step, 4'-phosphopantetheine is adenylylated to form dephospho-CoA by the enzyme phosphopantetheine adenylyl transferase (CoaD)Finally, dephospho-CoA is phosphorylated using ATP to coenzyme A by the enzyme dephosphocoenzyme A kinase (CoaE). Since coenzyme A is, in chemical terms, a thiol, it can react with carboxylic acids to form thioesters, thus functioning as an acyl group carrier. CoA assists in transferring fatty acids from the cytoplasm to mitochondria. A molecule of coenzyme A carrying an acetyl group is also referred to as acetyl-CoA. When it is not attached to an acyl group, it is usually referred to as 'CoASH' or 'HSCoA'. Coenzyme A is also the source of the phosphopantetheine group that is added as a prosthetic group to proteins such as acyl carrier protein and formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase Acetyl-CoA is an important molecule itself. It is the precursor to HMG CoA, which is a vital component in cholesterol and ketone synthesis. Furthermore, it contributes an acetyl group to choline to produce acetylcholine, in a reaction catalysed by choline acetyltransferase. Its main task is conveying the carbon atoms within the acetyl group to the citric acid cycle to be oxidized for energy production. -- Wikipedia.

Azithromycin is derived from erythromycin; however, it differs chemically from erythromycin in that a methyl-substituted nitrogen atom is incorporated into the lactone ring, thus making the lactone ring 15-membered. Azithromycin is sold under the brand names Zithromax (Zmax) and Sumamed, and is one of the world's best-selling antibiotics. Azithromycin is used to treat certain bacterial infections, most often bacteria causing middle ear infections, tonsillitis, throat infections, laryngitis, bronchitis, pneumonia and sinusitis. It is also effective against certain sexually transmitted infectious diseases, such as non-gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis.

It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphoglycerol moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. As is the case with diacylglycerols, phosphatidylglycerols can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PG(16:0/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of palmitic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of arachidonic acid at the C-2 position. The palmitic acid moiety is derived from fish oils, milk fats, vegetable oils and animal fats, while the arachidonic acid moiety is derived from animal fats and eggs. Phosphatidylglycerol is present at a level of 1-2% in most animal tissues, but it can be the second most abundant phospholipid in lung surfactant at up to 11% of the total. It is well established that the concentration of phosphatidylglycerol increases during fetal development. Phosphatidylglycerol may be present in animal tissues merely as a precursor for diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin). Phosphatidylglycerol is formed from phosphatidic acid by a sequence of enzymatic reactions that proceeds via the intermediate, cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-diacylglycerol). Bioynthesis proceeds by condensation of phosphatidic acid and cytidine triphosphate with elimination of pyrophosphate via the action of phosphatidate cytidyltransferase (or CDP-synthase). CDP-diacylglycerol then reacts with glycerol-3-phosphate via phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase to form 3-sn-phosphatidyl-1'-sn-glycerol 3'-phosphoric acid, with the release of cytidine monophosphate (CMP). Finally, phosphatidylglycerol is formed by the action of specific phosphatases. While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PGs have a net charge of -1 at physiological pH and are found in high concentration in mitochondrial membranes and as components of pulmonary surfactant. PG also serves as a precursor for the synthesis of cardiolipin. PG is synthesized from CDP-diacylglycerol and glycerol-3-phosphate.

It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphoglycerol moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. As is the case with diacylglycerols, phosphatidylglycerols can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PG(16:0/20:3(5Z,8Z,11Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of palmitic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of mead acid at the C-2 position. The palmitic acid moiety is derived from fish oils, milk fats, vegetable oils and animal fats, while the mead acid moiety is derived from fish oils, liver and kidney. Phosphatidylglycerol is present at a level of 1-2% in most animal tissues, but it can be the second most abundant phospholipid in lung surfactant at up to 11% of the total. It is well established that the concentration of phosphatidylglycerol increases during fetal development. Phosphatidylglycerol may be present in animal tissues merely as a precursor for diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin). Phosphatidylglycerol is formed from phosphatidic acid by a sequence of enzymatic reactions that proceeds via the intermediate, cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-diacylglycerol). Bioynthesis proceeds by condensation of phosphatidic acid and cytidine triphosphate with elimination of pyrophosphate via the action of phosphatidate cytidyltransferase (or CDP-synthase). CDP-diacylglycerol then reacts with glycerol-3-phosphate via phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase to form 3-sn-phosphatidyl-1'-sn-glycerol 3'-phosphoric acid, with the release of cytidine monophosphate (CMP). Finally, phosphatidylglycerol is formed by the action of specific phosphatases. While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PGs have a net charge of -1 at physiological pH and are found in high concentration in mitochondrial membranes and as components of pulmonary surfactant. PG also serves as a precursor for the synthesis of cardiolipin. PG is synthesized from CDP-diacylglycerol and glycerol-3-phosphate.

They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids. In animal tissues, the alkyl and alkenyl moieties in both non-polar and phospholipids tend to be rather simple in composition with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 (double bond in position 9) predominating. Ether analogues of triacylglycerols, i.e. 1-alkyldiacyl-sn-glycerols, are present at trace levels only if at all in most animal tissues, but they can be major components of some marine lipids.

Angiotensin IV (AngIV) mediates important physiologic functions in the central nervous system, including blood flow regulation, processes underlying to learning and memory, and presents anticonvulsant activity. The presence of AngIV-specific binding sites has been identified in various mammalian tissues, including blood vessels, heart, kidney, and brain. Besides the presence of AngIV binding sites in the cardiovascular system, the major AngIV synthesizing enzymes aminopeptidase N (APN) and aminopeptidase B (APB) are also expressed in different cell types of this system. AngIV activates several protein kinases, including phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase, PI-dependent kinase-1, extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK), protein kinase B-&#945;/Akt, and p70 ribosomal S6 kinase. AngIV could contribute to vascular damage, increasing the production of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, the main chemokine involved in monocyte recruitment, and up-regulates the expression of the adhesion molecule intercellular adhesion molecule-1 that is involved in the attachment and transmigration of circulating cells into the damaged tissue.

774.6272323_MZ	Galactosylceramide (d18:1/20:0)	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Galactosylceramides (GalCer) are non-acidic monoglycosphingolipids, i.e. a sphingolipid with one carbohydrate moiety attached to a ceramide unit. They are an intermediate in sphingolipid metabolism and is the second to last step in the synthesis of digalactosylceramidesulfate. GalCer is generated from ceramide via the enzyme UDP-galactose ceramide galactosyltransferase [EC:2.4.1.47]. It can be converted to digalactosylceramide via the enzyme glycosyltransferases [EC 2.4.1.-]. Galactosylceramide is the principal glycosphingolipid in brain tissue, hence the trivial name cerebroside, which was first conferred on it in 1874. Galactosylceramides are found in all nervous tissues, but they can amount to 2% of the dry weight of grey matter and 12% of white matter. They are major constituents of oligodendrocytes. Synthesis of galactosylceramide takes place on the lumenal surface of the endoplasmic reticulum, although it has free access to the cytosolic surface by an energy-independent flip-flop process. GalCer sits in the extracellular leaflet of cell membranes in nanometer sized domains or rafts. The local clustering of GalCer within rafts is thought to facilitate the initial adhesion of certain viruses, including HIV-1 and bacteria to cells through multivalent interactions between receptor proteins and GalCer. A defect in the degradation of cerbrosides leads to a disorder called Krabbe disease. Krabbe disease (also known as globoid cell leukodystrophy or galactosylceramide lipidosis) is a rare, often fatal degenerative disorder that affects the myelin sheath of the nervous system. Krabbe disease is caused by mutations in the GALC gene, which causes a deficiency of galactosylceramidase. Infants with Krabbe disease are normal at birth. Symptoms begin between the ages of 3 and 6 months with irritability, fevers, limb stiffness, seizures, feeding difficulties, vomiting, and slowing of mental and motor development. There are also juvenile- and adult-onset cases of Krabbe disease, which have similar symptoms but slower progression. In infants, the disease is generally fatal before age 2. Patients with late-onset Krabbe disease tend to have a slower progression of the disease and live significantly longer.Cerebrosides are glycosphingolipids. There are four types of glycosphingolipids, the cerebrosides, sulfatides, globosides and gangliosides. Cerebrosides have a single sugar group linked to ceramide. The most common are galactocerebrosides (containing galactose), the least common are glucocerebrosides (containing glucose). Galactocerebrosides are found predominantly in neuronal cell membranes. In contrast glucocerebrosides are not normally found in membranes. Instead, they are typically intermediates in the synthesis or degradation of more complex glycosphingolipids. Galactocerebrosides are synthesized from ceramide and UDP-galactose. Excess lysosomal accumulation of glucocerebrosides is found in Gaucher disease.

779.4440284_MZ	Digoxin	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside extracted from the foxglove plant, digitalis. It is widely used in the treatment of various heart conditions, namely atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter and congestive heart failure that cannot be controlled by other medication. Digoxin preparations are commonly marketed under the trade name Lanoxin. Digoxin has positive inotropic and negative chronotropic activity. It is used to control ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation and in the management of congestive heart failure with atrial fibrillation. Its use in congestive heart failure and sinus rhythm is less certain. The margin between toxic and therapeutic doses is small. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p666) -- Pubchem; Digoxin is a cardiotonic glycoside obtained mainly from Digitalis lanata; It consists of three sugars and the aglycone digoxigenin. Digoxin binds to a site on the extracellular aspect of the of the Na+/K+ ATPase pump in the membranes of heart cells (myocytes). This causes an increase in the level of sodium ions in the myocytes, which then leads to a rise in the level of calcium ions. The proposed mechanism is the following: inhibition of the Na+/K+ pump leads to increased Na+ levels, which in turn slows down the extrusion of Ca2+ via the Na+/Ca2+ exchange pump. Increased amounts of Ca2+ are then stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and released by each action potential, which is unchanged by digoxin. This is a different mechanism from that of catecholamines. -- Wikipedia; Owing to its narrow therapeutic index (the margin between effectiveness and toxicity), side effects of digoxin are inevitable. Nausea, vomiting and GIT upset are common, especially in higher doses. Decreased conduction in the AV node can lead to AV blocks, increased intracellular Ca2+ causes a type of arrhythmia called bigeminy (coupled beats), eventually ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. An often described but rarely seen side effect of digoxin is a disturbance of color vision (mostly yellow and green color) called xanthopsia.

It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylserine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. As is the case with diacylglycerols, glycerophosphoserines can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PS(16:0/18:1(9Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of palmitic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of oleic acid at the C-2 position. The palmitic acid moiety is derived from fish oils, milk fats, vegetable oils and animal fats, while the oleic acid moiety is derived from vegetable oils, especially olive and canola oil. Phosphatidylserine or 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine is distributed widely among animals, plants and microorganisms. It is usually less than 10% of the total phospholipids, the greatest concentration being in myelin from brain tissue. However, it may comprise 10 to 20 mol% of the total phospholipid in the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum of the cell. Phosphatidylserine is an acidic (anionic) phospholipid with three ionizable groups, i.e. the phosphate moiety, the amino group and the carboxyl function. As with other acidic lipids, it exists in nature in salt form, but it has a high propensity to chelate to calcium via the charged oxygen atoms of both the carboxyl and phosphate moieties, modifying the conformation of the polar head group. This interaction may be of considerable relevance to the biological function of phosphatidylserine, especially during bone formation for example. As phosphatidylserine is located entirely on the inner monolayer surface of the plasma membrane (and of other cellular membranes) and it is the most abundant anionic phospholipids. Therefore phosphatidylseriine may make the largest contribution to interfacial effects in membranes involving non-specific electrostatic interactions. This normal distribution is disturbed during platelet activation and cellular apoptosis. In human plasma, 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl and 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl species predominate, but in brain (especially grey matter), retina and many other tissues 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl species are very abundant. Indeed, the ratio of n-3 to n-6 fatty acids in brain phosphatidylserine is very much higher than in most other lipids. While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. Phosphatidylserines typically carry a net charge of -1 at physiological pH. They mostly have palmitic or stearic acid on carbon 1 and a long chain unsaturated fatty acid (e.g. 18:2, 20:4 and 22:6) on carbon 2.

It usually consists of phosphorylcholine and ceramide. In humans, sphingomyelin is the only membrane phospholipid not derived from glycerol. Like all sphingolipids, SPH has a ceramide core (sphingosine bonded to a fatty acid via an amide linkage). In addition it contains one polar head group, which is either phosphocholine or phosphoethanolamine. The plasma membrane of cells is highly enriched in sphingomyelin and is considered largely to be found in the exoplasmic leaflet of the cell membrane. However, there is some evidence that there may also be a sphingomyelin pool in the inner leaflet of the membrane. Moreover, neutral sphingomyelinase-2 - an enzyme that breaks down sphingomyelin into ceramide has been found to localise exclusively to the inner leaflet further suggesting that there may be sphingomyelin present there. Sphingomyelin can accumulate in a rare hereditary disease called Niemann-Pick Disease, types A and B. Niemann-Pick disease is a genetically-inherited disease caused by a deficiency in the enzyme Sphingomyelinase, which causes the accumulation of Sphingomyelin in spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow, and the brain, causing irreversible neurological damage. SMs play a role in signal transduction. Sphingomyelins are synthesized by the transfer of phosphorylcholine from phosphatidylcholine to a ceramide in a reaction catalyzed by sphingomyelin synthase.

They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids.

It is a glyceride consisting of two fatty acid chains covalently bonded to a glycerol molecule through ester linkages. Diacylglycerols can have many different combinations of fatty acids attached at both the C-1 and C-2 positions. DG(24:1(15Z)/24:1(15Z)/0:0), in particular, consists of two chains of nervonic acid at the C-1 and C-2 positions. The nervonic acid moieties are derived from fish oils. Mono- and diacylglycerols are common food additives used to blend together certain ingredients, such as oil and water, which would not otherwise blend well. Dacylglycerols are often found in bakery products, beverages, ice cream, chewing gum, shortening, whipped toppings, margarine, and confections. Synthesis of diacylglycerol begins with glycerol-3-phosphate, which is derived primarily from dihydroxyacetone phosphate, a product of glycolysis (usually in the cytoplasm of liver or adipose tissue cells). Glycerol-3-phosphate is first acylated with acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) to form lysophosphatidic acid, which is then acylated with another molecule of acyl-CoA to yield phosphatidic acid. Phosphatidic acid is then de-phosphorylated to form diacylglycerol.Diacylglycerols are precursors to triacylglycerols (triglyceride), which are formed by the addition of a third fatty acid to the diacylglycerol under the catalysis of diglyceride acyltransferase. Since diacylglycerols are synthesized via phosphatidic acid, they will usually contain a saturated fatty acid at the C-1 position on the glycerol moiety and an unsaturated fatty acid at the C-2 position.

As is the case with diacylglycerols, glycerophosphocholines can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PC(18:1(11Z)/P-18:1(11Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of vaccenic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of plasmalogen 18:1n7 at the C-2 position. The vaccenic acid moiety is derived from butter fat and animal fat, while the plasmalogen 18:1n7 moiety is derived from animal fats, liver and kidney. Phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, as well as being involved in metabolism and signaling. While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PCs can be synthesized via three different routes. In one route, choline is activated first by phosphorylation and then by coupling to CDP prior to attachment to phosphatidic acid. PCs can also synthesized by the addition of choline to CDP-activated 1,2-diacylglycerol. A third route to PC synthesis involves the conversion of either PS or PE to PC. Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids. In animal tissues, the alkyl and alkenyl moieties in both non-polar and phospholipids tend to be rather simple in composition with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 (double bond in position 9) predominating.

Triglycerides (TGs) are also known as triacylglycerols or triacylglycerides, meaning that they are glycerides in which the glycerol is esterified with three fatty acid groups (i.e. fatty acid tri-esters of glycerol). TGs may be divided into three general types with respect to their acyl substituents. They are simple or monoacid if they contain only one type of fatty acid, diacid if they contain two types of fatty acids and triacid if three different acyl groups. Chain lengths of the fatty acids in naturally occurring triglycerides can be of varying lengths and saturations but 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. TG(16:0/14:0/18:1(9Z))[iso6], in particular, consists of one chain of palmitic acid at the C-1 position, one chain of myristic acid at the C-2 position and one chain of oleic acid at the C-3 position. TGs are the main constituent of vegetable oil and animal fats. TGs are major components of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicrons, play an important role in metabolism as energy sources and transporters of dietary fat. They contain more than twice the energy (9 kcal/g) of carbohydrates and proteins. In the intestine, triglycerides are split into glycerol and fatty acids (this process is called lipolysis) with the help of lipases and bile secretions, which can then move into blood vessels. The triglycerides are rebuilt in the blood from their fragments and become constituents of lipoproteins, which deliver the fatty acids to and from fat cells among other functions. Various tissues can release the free fatty acids and take them up as a source of energy. Fat cells can synthesize and store triglycerides. When the body requires fatty acids as an energy source, the hormone glucagon signals the breakdown of the triglycerides by hormone-sensitive lipase to release free fatty acids. As the brain cannot utilize fatty acids as an energy source, the glycerol component of triglycerides can be converted into glucose for brain fuel when it is broken down. (www.cyberlipid.org, www.wikipedia.org)TAGs can serve as fatty acid stores in all cells, but primarily in adipocytes of adipose tissue. The major building block for the synthesis of triacylglycerides, in non-adipose tissue, is glycerol. Adipocytes lack glycerol kinase and so must use another route to TAG synthesis. Specifically, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), which is produced during glycolysis, is the precursor for TAG synthesis in adipose tissue. DHAP can also serve as a TAG precursor in non-adipose tissues, but does so to a much lesser extent than glycerol. The use of DHAP for the TAG backbone depends on whether the synthesis of the TAGs occurs in the mitochondria and ER or the ER and the peroxisomes. The ER/mitochondria pathway requires the action of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to convert DHAP to glycerol-3-phosphate. Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase then esterifies a fatty acid to glycerol-3-phosphate thereby generating lysophosphatidic acid. The ER/peroxisome reaction pathway uses the peroxisomal enzyme DHAP acyltransferase to acylate DHAP to acyl-DHAP which is then reduced by acyl-DHAP reductase. The fatty acids that are incorporated into TAGs are activated to acyl-CoAs through the action of acyl-CoA synthetases. Two molecules of acyl-CoA are esterified to glycerol-3-phosphate to yield 1,2-diacylglycerol phosphate (also known as phosphatidic acid). The phosphate is then removed by phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP1), to generate 1,2-diacylglycerol. This diacylglycerol serves as the substrate for addition of the third fatty acid to make TAG. Intestinal monoacylglycerols, derived from dietary fats, can also serve as substrates for the synthesis of 1,2-diacylglycerols.

Phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, as well as being involved in metabolism and signaling.While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PCs can be synthesized via three different routes. In one route, choline is activated first by phosphorylation and then by coupling to CDP prior to attachment to phosphatidic acid. PCs can also synthesized by the addition of choline to CDP-activated 1,2-diacylglycerol. A third route to PC synthesis involves the conversion of either PS or PE to PC.

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is a metabolic disorder of haeme biosynthesis caused by decreased activity of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase. Porphyria cutanea tarda is manifest by fragility, erosions, bullae, milia and scars on sun-exposed skin. Excess porphyrins in the skin interact with light of approximately 400 nm-wavelength radiant energy, forming reactive oxygen species. Porphyria cutanea tarda is categorized as familial, acquired or toxic. Factors that may induce clinical expression of PCT in susceptible individuals include alcohol, oestrogen, iron, polyhalogenated compounds and viral infections. Porphyria cutanea tarda is associated with an increased incidence of the haemochromatosis gene. Treatments for PCT include withdrawal of aggravating factors, phlebotomy and oral antimalarial medications. Porphyria cutanea tarda is associated with hepatic iron overload and responds to iron-reduction therapy. Porphyria cutanea tarda is the most common porphyria, followed by acute intermittent porphyria and erythropoietic protoporphyria. The molecular genetics of the porphyrias is very heterogenous.

805.7134263_MZ	Tricaprylic glyceride (16:0/14:0/18:0)[iso6]	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	TG(16:0/14:0/18:0)[iso6] is a monostearic acid triglyceride. Triglycerides (TGs) are also known as triacylglycerols or triacylglycerides, meaning that they are glycerides in which the glycerol is esterified with three fatty acid groups (i.e. fatty acid tri-esters of glycerol). TGs may be divided into three general types with respect to their acyl substituents. They are simple or monoacid if they contain only one type of fatty acid, diacid if they contain two types of fatty acids and triacid if three different acyl groups. Chain lengths of the fatty acids in naturally occurring triglycerides can be of varying lengths and saturations but 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. TG(16:0/14:0/18:0)[iso6], in particular, consists of one chain of palmitic acid at the C-1 position, one chain of myristic acid at the C-2 position and one chain of stearic acid at the C-3 position. TGs are the main constituent of vegetable oil and animal fats. TGs are major components of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicrons, play an important role in metabolism as energy sources and transporters of dietary fat. They contain more than twice the energy (9 kcal/g) of carbohydrates and proteins. In the intestine, triglycerides are split into glycerol and fatty acids (this process is called lipolysis) with the help of lipases and bile secretions, which can then move into blood vessels. The triglycerides are rebuilt in the blood from their fragments and become constituents of lipoproteins, which deliver the fatty acids to and from fat cells among other functions. Various tissues can release the free fatty acids and take them up as a source of energy. Fat cells can synthesize and store triglycerides. When the body requires fatty acids as an energy source, the hormone glucagon signals the breakdown of the triglycerides by hormone-sensitive lipase to release free fatty acids. As the brain cannot utilize fatty acids as an energy source, the glycerol component of triglycerides can be converted into glucose for brain fuel when it is broken down. (www.cyberlipid.org, www.wikipedia.org)TAGs can serve as fatty acid stores in all cells, but primarily in adipocytes of adipose tissue. The major building block for the synthesis of triacylglycerides, in non-adipose tissue, is glycerol. Adipocytes lack glycerol kinase and so must use another route to TAG synthesis. Specifically, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), which is produced during glycolysis, is the precursor for TAG synthesis in adipose tissue. DHAP can also serve as a TAG precursor in non-adipose tissues, but does so to a much lesser extent than glycerol. The use of DHAP for the TAG backbone depends on whether the synthesis of the TAGs occurs in the mitochondria and ER or the ER and the peroxisomes. The ER/mitochondria pathway requires the action of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to convert DHAP to glycerol-3-phosphate. Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase then esterifies a fatty acid to glycerol-3-phosphate thereby generating lysophosphatidic acid. The ER/peroxisome reaction pathway uses the peroxisomal enzyme DHAP acyltransferase to acylate DHAP to acyl-DHAP which is then reduced by acyl-DHAP reductase. The fatty acids that are incorporated into TAGs are activated to acyl-CoAs through the action of acyl-CoA synthetases. Two molecules of acyl-CoA are esterified to glycerol-3-phosphate to yield 1,2-diacylglycerol phosphate (also known as phosphatidic acid).

It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylserine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. As is the case with diacylglycerols, glycerophosphoserines can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PS(18:1(9Z)/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of oleic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of arachidonic acid at the C-2 position. The oleic acid moiety is derived from vegetable oils, especially olive and canola oil, while the arachidonic acid moiety is derived from animal fats and eggs. Phosphatidylserine or 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine is distributed widely among animals, plants and microorganisms. It is usually less than 10% of the total phospholipids, the greatest concentration being in myelin from brain tissue. However, it may comprise 10 to 20 mol% of the total phospholipid in the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum of the cell. Phosphatidylserine is an acidic (anionic) phospholipid with three ionizable groups, i.e. the phosphate moiety, the amino group and the carboxyl function. As with other acidic lipids, it exists in nature in salt form, but it has a high propensity to chelate to calcium via the charged oxygen atoms of both the carboxyl and phosphate moieties, modifying the conformation of the polar head group. This interaction may be of considerable relevance to the biological function of phosphatidylserine, especially during bone formation for example. As phosphatidylserine is located entirely on the inner monolayer surface of the plasma membrane (and of other cellular membranes) and it is the most abundant anionic phospholipids. Therefore phosphatidylseriine may make the largest contribution to interfacial effects in membranes involving non-specific electrostatic interactions. This normal distribution is disturbed during platelet activation and cellular apoptosis. In human plasma, 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl and 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl species predominate, but in brain (especially grey matter), retina and many other tissues 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl species are very abundant. Indeed, the ratio of n-3 to n-6 fatty acids in brain phosphatidylserine is very much higher than in most other lipids. While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. Phosphatidylserines typically carry a net charge of -1 at physiological pH. They mostly have palmitic or stearic acid on carbon 1 and a long chain unsaturated fatty acid (e.g. 18:2, 20:4 and 22:6) on carbon 2. PS biosynthesis involves an exchange reaction of serine for ethanolamine in PE.

808.6669992_MZ	Galactosylceramide (d18:1/24:1(15Z))	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Galactosylceramides (GalCer) are non-acidic monoglycosphingolipids, i.e. a sphingolipid with one carbohydrate moiety attached to a ceramide unit. They are an intermediate in sphingolipid metabolism and is the second to last step in the synthesis of digalactosylceramidesulfate. GalCer is generated from ceramide via the enzyme UDP-galactose ceramide galactosyltransferase [EC:2.4.1.47]. It can be converted to digalactosylceramide via the enzyme glycosyltransferases [EC 2.4.1.-]. Galactosylceramide is the principal glycosphingolipid in brain tissue, hence the trivial name cerebroside, which was first conferred on it in 1874. Galactosylceramides are found in all nervous tissues, but they can amount to 2% of the dry weight of grey matter and 12% of white matter. They are major constituents of oligodendrocytes. Synthesis of galactosylceramide takes place on the lumenal surface of the endoplasmic reticulum, although it has free access to the cytosolic surface by an energy-independent flip-flop process. GalCer sits in the extracellular leaflet of cell membranes in nanometer sized domains or rafts. The local clustering of GalCer within rafts is thought to facilitate the initial adhesion of certain viruses, including HIV-1 and bacteria to cells through multivalent interactions between receptor proteins and GalCer. A defect in the degradation of cerbrosides leads to a disorder called Krabbe disease. Krabbe disease (also known as globoid cell leukodystrophy or galactosylceramide lipidosis) is a rare, often fatal degenerative disorder that affects the myelin sheath of the nervous system. Krabbe disease is caused by mutations in the GALC gene, which causes a deficiency of galactosylceramidase. Infants with Krabbe disease are normal at birth. Symptoms begin between the ages of 3 and 6 months with irritability, fevers, limb stiffness, seizures, feeding difficulties, vomiting, and slowing of mental and motor development. There are also juvenile- and adult-onset cases of Krabbe disease, which have similar symptoms but slower progression. In infants, the disease is generally fatal before age 2. Patients with late-onset Krabbe disease tend to have a slower progression of the disease and live significantly longer.Cerebrosides are glycosphingolipids. There are four types of glycosphingolipids, the cerebrosides, sulfatides, globosides and gangliosides. Cerebrosides have a single sugar group linked to ceramide. The most common are galactocerebrosides (containing galactose), the least common are glucocerebrosides (containing glucose). Galactocerebrosides are found predominantly in neuronal cell membranes. In contrast glucocerebrosides are not normally found in membranes. Instead, they are typically intermediates in the synthesis or degradation of more complex glycosphingolipids. Galactocerebrosides are synthesized from ceramide and UDP-galactose. Excess lysosomal accumulation of glucocerebrosides is found in Gaucher disease.

Phosphatidylinositols are important lipids, both as a key membrane constituent and as a participant in essential metabolic processes, both directly and via a number of metabolites. Phosphatidylinositols are acidic (anionic) phospholipids that consist of a phosphatidic acid backbone, linked via the phosphate group to inositol (hexahydroxycyclohexane). Phosphatidylinositols can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PI(16:0/16:0), in particular, consists of one chain of palmitic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of palmitic acid at the C-2 position. The palmitic acid moiety is derived from fish oils, milk fats, vegetable oils and animal fats, while the palmitic acid moiety is derived from fish oils, milk fats, vegetable oils and animal fats. In most organisms, the stereochemical form of the last is myo-D-inositol (with one axial hydroxyl in position 2 with the remainder equatorial. Phosphatidylinositol is especially abundant in brain tissue, where it can amount to 10% of the phospholipids, but it is present in all tissues and cell types. There is usually less of it than of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine. In animal tissues, phosphatidylinositol is the primary source of the arachidonic acid required for biosynthesis of eicosanoids, including prostaglandins, via the action of the enzyme phospholipase A2. Phosphatidylinositol can be phosphorylated by a number of different kinases that place the phosphate moiety on positions 4 and 5 of the inositol ring, although position 3 can also be phosphorylated by a specific kinase. Seven different isomers are known, but the most important in both quantitative and biological terms are phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Phosphatidylinositol and the phosphatidylinositol phosphates are the main source of diacylglycerols that serve as signaling molecules, via the action of phospholipase C enzymes.While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PIs contain almost exclusively stearic acid at carbon 1 and arachidonic acid at carbon 2. PIs composed exclusively of non-phosphorylated inositol exhibit a net charge of -1 at physiological pH. Molecules with phosphorylated inositol (such as PIP, PIP2, PIP3, etc.) are termed polyphosphoinositides. The polyphosphoinositides are important intracellular transducers of signals emanating from the plasma membrane. The synthesis of PI involves CDP-activated 1,2-diacylglycerol condensation with myo-inositol.

As with other acidic lipids, it exists in nature in salt form, but it has a high propensity to chelate to calcium via the charged oxygen atoms of both the carboxyl and phosphate moieties, modifying the conformation of the polar head group. This interaction may be of considerable relevance to the biological function of phosphatidylserine, especially during bone formation for example. As phosphatidylserine is located entirely on the inner monolayer surface of the plasma membrane (and of other cellular membranes) and it is the most abundant anionic phospholipids. Therefore phosphatidylseriine may make the largest contribution to interfacial effects in membranes involving non-specific electrostatic interactions. This normal distribution is disturbed during platelet activation and cellular apoptosis. In human plasma, 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl and 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl species predominate, but in brain (especially grey matter), retina and many other tissues 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl species are very abundant. Indeed, the ratio of n-3 to n-6 fatty acids in brain phosphatidylserine is very much higher than in most other lipids. While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. Phosphatidylserines typically carry a net charge of -1 at physiological pH. They mostly have palmitic or stearic acid on carbon 1 and a long chain unsaturated fatty acid (e.g. 18:2, 20:4 and 22:6) on carbon 2. PS biosynthesis involves an exchange reaction of serine for ethanolamine in PE.

It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphoglycerol moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. As is the case with diacylglycerols, phosphatidylglycerols can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PG(16:1(9Z)/22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of palmitoleic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of docosahexaenoic acid at the C-2 position. The palmitoleic acid moiety is derived from animal fats and vegetable oils, while the docosahexaenoic acid moiety is derived from fish oils. Phosphatidylglycerol is present at a level of 1-2% in most animal tissues, but it can be the second most abundant phospholipid in lung surfactant at up to 11% of the total. It is well established that the concentration of phosphatidylglycerol increases during fetal development. Phosphatidylglycerol may be present in animal tissues merely as a precursor for diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin). Phosphatidylglycerol is formed from phosphatidic acid by a sequence of enzymatic reactions that proceeds via the intermediate, cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-diacylglycerol). Bioynthesis proceeds by condensation of phosphatidic acid and cytidine triphosphate with elimination of pyrophosphate via the action of phosphatidate cytidyltransferase (or CDP-synthase). CDP-diacylglycerol then reacts with glycerol-3-phosphate via phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase to form 3-sn-phosphatidyl-1'-sn-glycerol 3'-phosphoric acid, with the release of cytidine monophosphate (CMP). Finally, phosphatidylglycerol is formed by the action of specific phosphatases. While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes.

The docosahexaenoic acid moiety is derived from fish oils, while the plasmalogen 18:1n7 moiety is derived from animal fats, liver and kidney. Phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, as well as being involved in metabolism and signaling.

PCs can be synthesized via three different routes. In one route, choline is activated first by phosphorylation and then by coupling to CDP prior to attachment to phosphatidic acid. PCs can also synthesized by the addition of choline to CDP-activated 1,2-diacylglycerol. A third route to PC synthesis involves the conversion of either PS or PE to PC. Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids. In animal tissues, the alkyl and alkenyl moieties in both non-polar and phospholipids tend to be rather simple in composition with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 (double bond in position 9) predominating. Ether analogues of triacylglycerols, i.e. 1-alkyldiacyl-sn-glycerols, are present at trace levels only if at all in most animal tissues, but they can be major components of some marine lipids.

PE synthesis can occur via two pathways. The first requires that ethanolamine be activated by phosphorylation and then coupled to CDP.

Finally, phosphatidylglycerol is formed by the action of specific phosphatases. While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PGs have a net charge of -1 at physiological pH and are found in high concentration in mitochondrial membranes and as components of pulmonary surfactant. PG also serves as a precursor for the synthesis of cardiolipin. PG is synthesized from CDP-diacylglycerol and glycerol-3-phosphate.

The stearic acid moiety is derived from animal fats, coco butter and sesame oil, while the docosahexaenoic acid moiety is derived from fish oils. Phosphatidylglycerol is present at a level of 1-2% in most animal tissues, but it can be the second most abundant phospholipid in lung surfactant at up to 11% of the total. It is well established that the concentration of phosphatidylglycerol increases during fetal development. Phosphatidylglycerol may be present in animal tissues merely as a precursor for diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin). Phosphatidylglycerol is formed from phosphatidic acid by a sequence of enzymatic reactions that proceeds via the intermediate, cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-diacylglycerol).

It is a component the cell plasma membrane which modulates cell signal transduction events. Gangliosides have been found to be highly important in immunology. Ganglioside GL1a carries a net-negative charge at pH 7.0 and is acidic. Gangliosides can amount to 6% of the weight of lipids from brain, but they are found at low levels in all animal tissues.Cerebrosides are glycosphingolipids. There are four types of glycosphingolipids, the cerebrosides, sulfatides, globosides and gangliosides. Cerebrosides have a single sugar group linked to ceramide. The most common are galactocerebrosides (containing galactose), the least common are glucocerebrosides (containing glucose). Galactocerebrosides are found predominantly in neuronal cell membranes. In contrast glucocerebrosides are not normally found in membranes. Instead, they are typically intermediates in the synthesis or degradation of more complex glycosphingolipids. Galactocerebrosides are synthesized from ceramide and UDP-galactose. Excess lysosomal accumulation of glucocerebrosides is found in Gaucher disease.

It usually consists of phosphorylcholine and ceramide. In humans, sphingomyelin is the only membrane phospholipid not derived from glycerol. Like all sphingolipids, SPH has a ceramide core (sphingosine bonded to a fatty acid via an amide linkage). In addition it contains one polar head group, which is either phosphocholine or phosphoethanolamine. The plasma membrane of cells is highly enriched in sphingomyelin and is considered largely to be found in the exoplasmic leaflet of the cell membrane. However, there is some evidence that there may also be a sphingomyelin pool in the inner leaflet of the membrane. Moreover, neutral sphingomyelinase-2 - an enzyme that breaks down sphingomyelin into ceramide has been found to localise exclusively to the inner leaflet further suggesting that there may be sphingomyelin present there. Sphingomyelin can accumulate in a rare hereditary disease called Niemann-Pick Disease, types A and B. Niemann-Pick disease is a genetically-inherited disease caused by a deficiency in the enzyme Sphingomyelinase, which causes the accumulation of Sphingomyelin in spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow, and the brain, causing irreversible neurological damage. SMs play a role in signal transduction. Sphingomyelins are synthesized by the transfer of phosphorylcholine from phosphatidylcholine to a ceramide in a reaction catalyzed by sphingomyelin synthase.

It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylserine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. As is the case with diacylglycerols, glycerophosphoserines can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PS(18:1(9Z)/22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of oleic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of docosahexaenoic acid at the C-2 position. The oleic acid moiety is derived from vegetable oils, especially olive and canola oil, while the docosahexaenoic acid moiety is derived from fish oils. Phosphatidylserine or 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine is distributed widely among animals, plants and microorganisms. It is usually less than 10% of the total phospholipids, the greatest concentration being in myelin from brain tissue. However, it may comprise 10 to 20 mol% of the total phospholipid in the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum of the cell. Phosphatidylserine is an acidic (anionic) phospholipid with three ionizable groups, i.e. the phosphate moiety, the amino group and the carboxyl function. As with other acidic lipids, it exists in nature in salt form, but it has a high propensity to chelate to calcium via the charged oxygen atoms of both the carboxyl and phosphate moieties, modifying the conformation of the polar head group. This interaction may be of considerable relevance to the biological function of phosphatidylserine, especially during bone formation for example. As phosphatidylserine is located entirely on the inner monolayer surface of the plasma membrane (and of other cellular membranes) and it is the most abundant anionic phospholipids. Therefore phosphatidylseriine may make the largest contribution to interfacial effects in membranes involving non-specific electrostatic interactions. This normal distribution is disturbed during platelet activation and cellular apoptosis. In human plasma, 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl and 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl species predominate, but in brain (especially grey matter), retina and many other tissues 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl species are very abundant. Indeed, the ratio of n-3 to n-6 fatty acids in brain phosphatidylserine is very much higher than in most other lipids. While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. Phosphatidylserines typically carry a net charge of -1 at physiological pH. They mostly have palmitic or stearic acid on carbon 1 and a long chain unsaturated fatty acid (e.g. 18:2, 20:4 and 22:6) on carbon 2. PS biosynthesis involves an exchange reaction of serine for ethanolamine in PE.

Phosphatidylinositols are important lipids, both as a key membrane constituent and as a participant in essential metabolic processes, both directly and via a number of metabolites. Phosphatidylinositols are acidic (anionic) phospholipids that consist of a phosphatidic acid backbone, linked via the phosphate group to inositol (hexahydroxycyclohexane). Phosphatidylinositols can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PI(16:0/18:2(9Z,12Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of palmitic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of linoleic acid at the C-2 position. The palmitic acid moiety is derived from fish oils, milk fats, vegetable oils and animal fats, while the linoleic acid moiety is derived from seed oils. In most organisms, the stereochemical form of the last is myo-D-inositol (with one axial hydroxyl in position 2 with the remainder equatorial. Phosphatidylinositol is especially abundant in brain tissue, where it can amount to 10% of the phospholipids, but it is present in all tissues and cell types. There is usually less of it than of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine. In animal tissues, phosphatidylinositol is the primary source of the arachidonic acid required for biosynthesis of eicosanoids, including prostaglandins, via the action of the enzyme phospholipase A2. Phosphatidylinositol can be phosphorylated by a number of different kinases that place the phosphate moiety on positions 4 and 5 of the inositol ring, although position 3 can also be phosphorylated by a specific kinase. Seven different isomers are known, but the most important in both quantitative and biological terms are phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Phosphatidylinositol and the phosphatidylinositol phosphates are the main source of diacylglycerols that serve as signaling molecules, via the action of phospholipase C enzymes.While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PIs contain almost exclusively stearic acid at carbon 1 and arachidonic acid at carbon 2. PIs composed exclusively of non-phosphorylated inositol exhibit a net charge of -1 at physiological pH. Molecules with phosphorylated inositol (such as PIP, PIP2, PIP3, etc.) are termed polyphosphoinositides. The polyphosphoinositides are important intracellular transducers of signals emanating from the plasma membrane. The synthesis of PI involves CDP-activated 1,2-diacylglycerol condensation with myo-inositol.

PEs are neutral zwitterions at physiological pH. They mostly have palmitic or stearic acid on carbon 1 and a long chain unsaturated fatty acid (e.g. 18:2, 20:4 and 22:6) on carbon 2. PE synthesis can occur via two pathways. The first requires that ethanolamine be activated by phosphorylation and then coupled to CDP. The ethanolamine is then transferred from CDP-ethanolamine to phosphatidic acid to yield PE. The second involves the decarboxylation of PS.

It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylserine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. As is the case with diacylglycerols, glycerophosphoserines can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PS(18:0/22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of stearic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of docosahexaenoic acid at the C-2 position. The stearic acid moiety is derived from animal fats, coco butter and sesame oil, while the docosahexaenoic acid moiety is derived from fish oils. Phosphatidylserine or 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine is distributed widely among animals, plants and microorganisms. It is usually less than 10% of the total phospholipids, the greatest concentration being in myelin from brain tissue. However, it may comprise 10 to 20 mol% of the total phospholipid in the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum of the cell. Phosphatidylserine is an acidic (anionic) phospholipid with three ionizable groups, i.e. the phosphate moiety, the amino group and the carboxyl function. As with other acidic lipids, it exists in nature in salt form, but it has a high propensity to chelate to calcium via the charged oxygen atoms of both the carboxyl and phosphate moieties, modifying the conformation of the polar head group. This interaction may be of considerable relevance to the biological function of phosphatidylserine, especially during bone formation for example. As phosphatidylserine is located entirely on the inner monolayer surface of the plasma membrane (and of other cellular membranes) and it is the most abundant anionic phospholipids. Therefore phosphatidylseriine may make the largest contribution to interfacial effects in membranes involving non-specific electrostatic interactions. This normal distribution is disturbed during platelet activation and cellular apoptosis. In human plasma, 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl and 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl species predominate, but in brain (especially grey matter), retina and many other tissues 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl species are very abundant. Indeed, the ratio of n-3 to n-6 fatty acids in brain phosphatidylserine is very much higher than in most other lipids.While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. Phosphatidylserines typically carry a net charge of -1 at physiological pH. They mostly have palmitic or stearic acid on carbon 1 and a long chain unsaturated fatty acid (e.g. 18:2, 20:4 and 22:6) on carbon 2.

Diadenosine polyphosphates (APnAs, n=3-6) are a family of endogenous vasoactive purine dinucleotides which have been isolated from thrombocytes. APnAs have been demonstrated to be involved in the control of vascular tone as well as the growth of vascular smooth muscle cells and hence, possibly, in atherogenesis. APnAs isolated substances are Ap3A, Ap4A, Ap5A, and Ap6A. APnAs are naturally occurring substances that facilitate tear secretion; they are released from the corneal epithelium, they stimulate tear production and therefore they may be considered as physiological modulators of tear secretion. The APnAs were discovered in the mid-sixties in the course of studies on aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS). APnAs have emerged as intracellular and extracellular signalling molecules implicated in the maintenance and regulation of vital cellular functions and become considered as second messengers. Great variety of physiological and pathological effects in mammalian cells was found to be associated with alterations of APnAs. APnAs are polyphosphated nucleotidic substances which are found in the CNS and are known to be released in a calcium-dependent manner from storage vesicles in brain synaptosomes. AP5A is a specific adenylate kinase inhibitor in the hippocampus, decreasing the rate of decomposition of ADP and the formation of ATP; a pathway that influences the availability of purines in the central nervous system. AP4A is the only APnA that can induce a considerable increase in [Ca2+] in endothelial cells, indicating that its vasoactive effects are comparable to the known effects of arginine vasopressin, Angiotensin II, and ATP. AP4A is a ubiquitous ApnA is a signal molecule for DNA replication in mammalian cells. AP4A is a primer for oligoadenylate synthesis catalyzed by interferon-inducible 2-5A synthetase. AP4A is an avid inhibitor of eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN). EDN is a catalytically proficient member of the pancreatic ribonuclease superfamily secreted along with other eosinophil granule proteins during innate host defense responses and various eosinophil-related inflammatory and allergic diseases. The ribonucleolytic activity of EDN is central to its antiviral and neurotoxic activities and possibly to other facets of its biological activity.

Phosphatidylinositols are important lipids, both as a key membrane constituent and as a participant in essential metabolic processes, both directly and via a number of metabolites. Phosphatidylinositols are acidic (anionic) phospholipids that consist of a phosphatidic acid backbone, linked via the phosphate group to inositol (hexahydroxycyclohexane). Phosphatidylinositols can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PI(16:0/18:0), in particular, consists of one chain of palmitic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of stearic acid at the C-2 position. The palmitic acid moiety is derived from fish oils, milk fats, vegetable oils and animal fats, while the stearic acid moiety is derived from animal fats, coco butter and sesame oil. In most organisms, the stereochemical form of the last is myo-D-inositol (with one axial hydroxyl in position 2 with the remainder equatorial. Phosphatidylinositol is especially abundant in brain tissue, where it can amount to 10% of the phospholipids, but it is present in all tissues and cell types. There is usually less of it than of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine. In animal tissues, phosphatidylinositol is the primary source of the arachidonic acid required for biosynthesis of eicosanoids, including prostaglandins, via the action of the enzyme phospholipase A2.

Triglycerides (TGs) are also known as triacylglycerols or triacylglycerides, meaning that they are glycerides in which the glycerol is esterified with three fatty acid groups (i.e. fatty acid trimesters of glycerol). TGs may be divided into three general types with respect to their acyl substituents. They are simple or monoacid if they contain only one type of fatty acid, diacid if they contain two types of fatty acids and triacid if three different acyl groups. Chain lengths of the fatty acids in naturally occurring triglycerides can be of varying lengths and saturations but 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. TG(15:0/18:1(9Z)/16:0), in particular, consists of one chain of pentadecanoic acid at the C-1 position, one chain of oleic acid at the C-2 position and one chain of palmitic acid at the C-3 position. TGs are the main constituent of vegetable oil and animal fats. TGs are major components of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicrons, play an important role in metabolism as energy sources and transporters of dietary fat. They contain more than twice the energy (9 kcal/g) of carbohydrates and proteins. In the intestine, triglycerides are split into glycerol and fatty acids (this process is called lipolysis) with the help of lipases and bile secretions, which can then move into blood vessels. The triglycerides are rebuilt in the blood from their fragments and become constituents of lipoproteins, which deliver the fatty acids to and from fat cells among other functions. Various tissues can release the free fatty acids and take them up as a source of energy. Fat cells can synthesize and store triglycerides. When the body requires fatty acids as an energy source, the hormone glucagon signals the breakdown of the triglycerides by hormone-sensitive lipase to release free fatty acids. As the brain cannot utilize fatty acids as an energy source, the glycerol component of triglycerides can be converted into glucose for brain fuel when it is broken down. (www.cyberlipid.org, www.wikipedia.org)TAGs can serve as fatty acid stores in all cells, but primarily in adipocytes of adipose tissue. The major building block for the synthesis of triacylglycerides, in non-adipose tissue, is glycerol. Adipocytes lack glycerol kinase and so must use another route to TAG synthesis. Specifically, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), which is produced during glycolysis, is the precursor for TAG synthesis in adipose tissue. DHAP can also serve as a TAG precursor in non-adipose tissues, but does so to a much lesser extent than glycerol. The use of DHAP for the TAG backbone depends on whether the synthesis of the TAGs occurs in the mitochondria and ER or the ER and the peroxisomes. The ER/mitochondria pathway requires the action of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to convert DHAP to glycerol-3-phosphate. Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase then esterifies a fatty acid to glycerol-3-phosphate thereby generating lysophosphatidic acid. The ER/peroxisome reaction pathway uses the peroxisomal enzyme DHAP acyltransferase to acylate DHAP to acyl-DHAP which is then reduced by acyl-DHAP reductase. The fatty acids that are incorporated into TAGs are activated to acyl-CoAs through the action of acyl-CoA synthetases. Two molecules of acyl-CoA are esterified to glycerol-3-phosphate to yield 1,2-diacylglycerol phosphate (also known as phosphatidic acid). The phosphate is then removed by phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP1), to generate 1,2-diacylglycerol. This diacylglycerol serves as the substrate for addition of the third fatty acid to make TAG. Intestinal monoacylglycerols, derived from dietary fats, can also serve as substrates for the synthesis of 1,2-diacylglycerols.

It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylcholine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. As is the case with diacylglycerols, glycerophosphocholines can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PC(18:0/22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of stearic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of docosahexaenoic acid at the C-2 position. The stearic acid moiety is derived from animal fats, coco butter and sesame oil, while the docosahexaenoic acid moiety is derived from fish oils. Phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, as well as being involved in metabolism and signaling.While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PCs can be synthesized via three different routes. In one route, choline is activated first by phosphorylation and then by coupling to CDP prior to attachment to phosphatidic acid. PCs can also synthesized by the addition of choline to CDP-activated 1,2-diacylglycerol. A third route to PC synthesis involves the conversion of either PS or PE to PC.

Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids.

854.1327512_MZ	Crotonoyl-CoA	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Crotonoyl-CoA is an important component in several metabolic pathways, notably fatty acid and amino acid metabolism. It is the substrate of a group of enzymes acyl-Coenzyme A oxidases 1, 2, 3 (E.C.: 1.3.3.6) corresponding to palmitoyl, branched chain, and pristanoyl, respectively, in the peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation, producing hydrogen peroxide. Abnormality of this group of enzymes is linked to coma, dehydration, diabetes, fatty liver, hyperinsulinemia, hyperlipidemia, and leukodystrophy. It is also a substrate of a group of enzymes called acyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase (E.C.:1.3.99-, including 1.3.99.2, 1.3.99.3) in the metabolism of fatty acids or branched chain amino acids in the mitochondria (Rozen et al., 1994). Acyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase (1.3.99.3) has shown to contribute to kidney-associated diseases, such as adrenogential syndrome, kidney failure, kidney tubular necrosis, homocystinuria, as well as other diseases including cretinism, encephalopathy, hypoglycemia, medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. The gene (ACADS) also plays a role in theta oscillation during sleep. In addition, crotonoyl-CoA is the substrate of enoyl coenzyme A hydratase (E.C.4.2.1.17) in the mitochondria during lysine degradation and tryptophan metabolism, benzoate degradation via CoA ligation; in contrast it is the product of this enzyme in the butanoate metabolism. Moreover, it is produced from multiple enzymes in the butanoate metabolism pathway, including 3-Hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase (E.C.:4.2.1.55), glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase (E.C.: 4.1.1.70), vinylacetyl-CoA &#916;-isomerase (E.C.: 5.3.3.3), and trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase (NAD+) (E.C.: 1.3.1.44). In lysine degradation and tryptophan metabolism, crotonoyl CoA is produced by glutaryl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase (E.C.:1.3.99.7) lysine and tryptophan metabolic pathway. This enzyme is linked to type-1glutaric aciduria, metabolic diseases, movement disorders, myelinopathy, and nervous system diseases.

Phosphatidylinositols are important lipids, both as a key membrane constituent and as a participant in essential metabolic processes, both directly and via a number of metabolites. Phosphatidylinositols are acidic (anionic) phospholipids that consist of a phosphatidic acid backbone, linked via the phosphate group to inositol (hexahydroxycyclohexane). Phosphatidylinositols can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PI(16:0/18:1(11Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of palmitic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of vaccenic acid at the C-2 position. The palmitic acid moiety is derived from fish oils, milk fats, vegetable oils and animal fats, while the vaccenic acid moiety is derived from butter fat and animal fat. In most organisms, the stereochemical form of the last is myo-D-inositol (with one axial hydroxyl in position 2 with the remainder equatorial. Phosphatidylinositol is especially abundant in brain tissue, where it can amount to 10% of the phospholipids, but it is present in all tissues and cell types. There is usually less of it than of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine. In animal tissues, phosphatidylinositol is the primary source of the arachidonic acid required for biosynthesis of eicosanoids, including prostaglandins, via the action of the enzyme phospholipase A2. Phosphatidylinositol can be phosphorylated by a number of different kinases that place the phosphate moiety on positions 4 and 5 of the inositol ring, although position 3 can also be phosphorylated by a specific kinase. Seven different isomers are known, but the most important in both quantitative and biological terms are phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Phosphatidylinositol and the phosphatidylinositol phosphates are the main source of diacylglycerols that serve as signaling molecules, via the action of phospholipase C enzymes.While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PIs contain almost exclusively stearic acid at carbon 1 and arachidonic acid at carbon 2. PIs composed exclusively of non-phosphorylated inositol exhibit a net charge of -1 at physiological pH. Molecules with phosphorylated inositol (such as PIP, PIP2, PIP3, etc.) are termed polyphosphoinositides. The polyphosphoinositides are important intracellular transducers of signals emanating from the plasma membrane. The synthesis of PI involves CDP-activated 1,2-diacylglycerol condensation with myo-inositol.

It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylserine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. As is the case with diacylglycerols, glycerophosphoserines can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PS(18:0/22:5(7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of stearic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of docosapentaenoic acid at the C-2 position. The stearic acid moiety is derived from animal fats, coco butter and sesame oil, while the docosapentaenoic acid moiety is derived from fish oils. Phosphatidylserine or 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine is distributed widely among animals, plants and microorganisms. It is usually less than 10% of the total phospholipids, the greatest concentration being in myelin from brain tissue. However, it may comprise 10 to 20 mol% of the total phospholipid in the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum of the cell. Phosphatidylserine is an acidic (anionic) phospholipid with three ionizable groups, i.e. the phosphate moiety, the amino group and the carboxyl function. As with other acidic lipids, it exists in nature in salt form, but it has a high propensity to chelate to calcium via the charged oxygen atoms of both the carboxyl and phosphate moieties, modifying the conformation of the polar head group. This interaction may be of considerable relevance to the biological function of phosphatidylserine, especially during bone formation for example. As phosphatidylserine is located entirely on the inner monolayer surface of the plasma membrane (and of other cellular membranes) and it is the most abundant anionic phospholipids. Therefore phosphatidylseriine may make the largest contribution to interfacial effects in membranes involving non-specific electrostatic interactions. This normal distribution is disturbed during platelet activation and cellular apoptosis. In human plasma, 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl and 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl species predominate, but in brain (especially grey matter), retina and many other tissues 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl species are very abundant. Indeed, the ratio of n-3 to n-6 fatty acids in brain phosphatidylserine is very much higher than in most other lipids.While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. Phosphatidylserines typically carry a net charge of -1 at physiological pH. They mostly have palmitic or stearic acid on carbon 1 and a long chain unsaturated fatty acid (e.g. 18:2, 20:4 and 22:6) on carbon 2. PS biosynthesis involves an exchange reaction of serine for ethanolamine in PE.

Phosphatidylinositols are acidic (anionic) phospholipids that consist of a phosphatidic acid backbone, linked via the phosphate group to inositol (hexahydroxycyclohexane). Phosphatidylinositols can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PI(16:0/20:3(5Z,8Z,11Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of palmitic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of mead acid at the C-2 position. The palmitic acid moiety is derived from fish oils, milk fats, vegetable oils and animal fats, while the mead acid moiety is derived from fish oils, liver and kidney. In most organisms, the stereochemical form of the last is myo-D-inositol (with one axial hydroxyl in position 2 with the remainder equatorial. Phosphatidylinositol is especially abundant in brain tissue, where it can amount to 10% of the phospholipids, but it is present in all tissues and cell types. There is usually less of it than of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine. In animal tissues, phosphatidylinositol is the primary source of the arachidonic acid required for biosynthesis of eicosanoids, including prostaglandins, via the action of the enzyme phospholipase A2. Phosphatidylinositol can be phosphorylated by a number of different kinases that place the phosphate moiety on positions 4 and 5 of the inositol ring, although position 3 can also be phosphorylated by a specific kinase. Seven different isomers are known, but the most important in both quantitative and biological terms are phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Phosphatidylinositol and the phosphatidylinositol phosphates are the main source of diacylglycerols that serve as signaling molecules, via the action of phospholipase C enzymes.While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PIs contain almost exclusively stearic acid at carbon 1 and arachidonic acid at carbon 2. PIs composed exclusively of non-phosphorylated inositol exhibit a net charge of -1 at physiological pH. Molecules with phosphorylated inositol (such as PIP, PIP2, PIP3, etc.) are termed polyphosphoinositides. The polyphosphoinositides are important intracellular transducers of signals emanating from the plasma membrane. The synthesis of PI involves CDP-activated 1,2-diacylglycerol condensation with myo-inositol.

It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylcholine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. As is the case with diacylglycerols, glycerophosphocholines can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common.

The g-linolenic acid moiety is derived from animal fats, while the nervonic acid moiety is derived from fish oils. Phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, as well as being involved in metabolism and signaling.While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PCs can be synthesized via three different routes. In one route, choline is activated first by phosphorylation and then by coupling to CDP prior to attachment to phosphatidic acid. PCs can also synthesized by the addition of choline to CDP-activated 1,2-diacylglycerol. A third route to PC synthesis involves the conversion of either PS or PE to PC.

It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylserine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. As is the case with diacylglycerols, glycerophosphoserines can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PS(20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)/22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of arachidonic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of docosahexaenoic acid at the C-2 position. The arachidonic acid moiety is derived from animal fats and eggs, while the docosahexaenoic acid moiety is derived from fish oils. Phosphatidylserine or 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine is distributed widely among animals, plants and microorganisms. It is usually less than 10% of the total phospholipids, the greatest concentration being in myelin from brain tissue. However, it may comprise 10 to 20 mol% of the total phospholipid in the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum of the cell. Phosphatidylserine is an acidic (anionic) phospholipid with three ionizable groups, i.e. the phosphate moiety, the amino group and the carboxyl function. As with other acidic lipids, it exists in nature in salt form, but it has a high propensity to chelate to calcium via the charged oxygen atoms of both the carboxyl and phosphate moieties, modifying the conformation of the polar head group. This interaction may be of considerable relevance to the biological function of phosphatidylserine, especially during bone formation for example. As phosphatidylserine is located entirely on the inner monolayer surface of the plasma membrane (and of other cellular membranes) and it is the most abundant anionic phospholipids. Therefore phosphatidylseriine may make the largest contribution to interfacial effects in membranes involving non-specific electrostatic interactions. This normal distribution is disturbed during platelet activation and cellular apoptosis. In human plasma, 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl and 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl species predominate, but in brain (especially grey matter), retina and many other tissues 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl species are very abundant. Indeed, the ratio of n-3 to n-6 fatty acids in brain phosphatidylserine is very much higher than in most other lipids. While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. Phosphatidylserines typically carry a net charge of -1 at physiological pH. They mostly have palmitic or stearic acid on carbon 1 and a long chain unsaturated fatty acid (e.g. 18:2, 20:4 and 22:6) on carbon 2. PS biosynthesis involves an exchange reaction of serine for ethanolamine in PE.

Triglycerides (TGs) are also known as triacylglycerols or triacylglycerides, meaning that they are glycerides in which the glycerol is esterified with three fatty acid groups (i.e. fatty acid tri-esters of glycerol). TGs may be divided into three general types with respect to their acyl substituents. They are simple or monoacid if they contain only one type of fatty acid, diacid if they contain two types of fatty acids and triacid if three different acyl groups. Chain lengths of the fatty acids in naturally occurring triglycerides can be of varying lengths and saturations but 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. TG(16:0/18:1(9Z)/18:2(9Z,12Z))[iso6], in particular, consists of one chain of palmitic acid at the C-1 position, one chain of oleic acid at the C-2 position and one chain of linoleic acid at the C-3 position. TGs are the main constituent of vegetable oil and animal fats. TGs are major components of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicrons, play an important role in metabolism as energy sources and transporters of dietary fat. They contain more than twice the energy (9 kcal/g) of carbohydrates and proteins. In the intestine, triglycerides are split into glycerol and fatty acids (this process is called lipolysis) with the help of lipases and bile secretions, which can then move into blood vessels. The triglycerides are rebuilt in the blood from their fragments and become constituents of lipoproteins, which deliver the fatty acids to and from fat cells among other functions. Various tissues can release the free fatty acids and take them up as a source of energy. Fat cells can synthesize and store triglycerides. When the body requires fatty acids as an energy source, the hormone glucagon signals the breakdown of the triglycerides by hormone-sensitive lipase to release free fatty acids. As the brain cannot utilize fatty acids as an energy source, the glycerol component of triglycerides can be converted into glucose for brain fuel when it is broken down. (www.cyberlipid.org, www.wikipedia.org)TAGs can serve as fatty acid stores in all cells, but primarily in adipocytes of adipose tissue. The major building block for the synthesis of triacylglycerides, in non-adipose tissue, is glycerol. Adipocytes lack glycerol kinase and so must use another route to TAG synthesis. Specifically, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), which is produced during glycolysis, is the precursor for TAG synthesis in adipose tissue. DHAP can also serve as a TAG precursor in non-adipose tissues, but does so to a much lesser extent than glycerol. The use of DHAP for the TAG backbone depends on whether the synthesis of the TAGs occurs in the mitochondria and ER or the ER and the peroxisomes. The ER/mitochondria pathway requires the action of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to convert DHAP to glycerol-3-phosphate. Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase then esterifies a fatty acid to glycerol-3-phosphate thereby generating lysophosphatidic acid. The ER/peroxisome reaction pathway uses the peroxisomal enzyme DHAP acyltransferase to acylate DHAP to acyl-DHAP which is then reduced by acyl-DHAP reductase. The fatty acids that are incorporated into TAGs are activated to acyl-CoAs through the action of acyl-CoA synthetases. Two molecules of acyl-CoA are esterified to glycerol-3-phosphate to yield 1,2-diacylglycerol phosphate (also known as phosphatidic acid). The phosphate is then removed by phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP1), to generate 1,2-diacylglycerol. This diacylglycerol serves as the substrate for addition of the third fatty acid to make TAG. Intestinal monoacylglycerols, derived from dietary fats, can also serve as substrates for the synthesis of 1,2-diacylglycerols.

The triglycerides are rebuilt in the blood from their fragments and become constituents of lipoproteins, which deliver the fatty acids to and from fat cells among other functions. Various tissues can release the free fatty acids and take them up as a source of energy. Fat cells can synthesize and store triglycerides. When the body requires fatty acids as an energy source, the hormone glucagon signals the breakdown of the triglycerides by hormone-sensitive lipase to release free fatty acids. As the brain cannot utilize fatty acids as an energy source, the glycerol component of triglycerides can be converted into glucose for brain fuel when it is broken down. (www.cyberlipid.org, www.wikipedia.org)TAGs can serve as fatty acid stores in all cells, but primarily in adipocytes of adipose tissue. The major building block for the synthesis of triacylglycerides, in non-adipose tissue, is glycerol. Adipocytes lack glycerol kinase and so must use another route to TAG synthesis. Specifically, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), which is produced during glycolysis, is the precursor for TAG synthesis in adipose tissue. DHAP can also serve as a TAG precursor in non-adipose tissues, but does so to a much lesser extent than glycerol. The use of DHAP for the TAG backbone depends on whether the synthesis of the TAGs occurs in the mitochondria and ER or the ER and the peroxisomes. The ER/mitochondria pathway requires the action of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to convert DHAP to glycerol-3-phosphate. Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase then esterifies a fatty acid to glycerol-3-phosphate thereby generating lysophosphatidic acid. The ER/peroxisome reaction pathway uses the peroxisomal enzyme DHAP acyltransferase to acylate DHAP to acyl-DHAP which is then reduced by acyl-DHAP reductase. The fatty acids that are incorporated into TAGs are activated to acyl-CoAs through the action of acyl-CoA synthetases. Two molecules of acyl-CoA are esterified to glycerol-3-phosphate to yield 1,2-diacylglycerol phosphate (also known as phosphatidic acid). The phosphate is then removed by phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP1), to generate 1,2-diacylglycerol. This diacylglycerol serves as the substrate for addition of the third fatty acid to make TAG. Intestinal monoacylglycerols, derived from dietary fats, can also serve as substrates for the synthesis of 1,2-diacylglycerols.

It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylserine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. As is the case with diacylglycerols, glycerophosphoserines can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PS(22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)/22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of docosahexaenoic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of docosahexaenoic acid at the C-2 position. The docosahexaenoic acid moiety is derived from fish oils, while the docosahexaenoic acid moiety is derived from fish oils. Phosphatidylserine or 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine is distributed widely among animals, plants and microorganisms. It is usually less than 10% of the total phospholipids, the greatest concentration being in myelin from brain tissue. However, it may comprise 10 to 20 mol% of the total phospholipid in the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum of the cell. Phosphatidylserine is an acidic (anionic) phospholipid with three ionizable groups, i.e. the phosphate moiety, the amino group and the carboxyl function. As with other acidic lipids, it exists in nature in salt form, but it has a high propensity to chelate to calcium via the charged oxygen atoms of both the carboxyl and phosphate moieties, modifying the conformation of the polar head group. This interaction may be of considerable relevance to the biological function of phosphatidylserine, especially during bone formation for example. As phosphatidylserine is located entirely on the inner monolayer surface of the plasma membrane (and of other cellular membranes) and it is the most abundant anionic phospholipids. Therefore phosphatidylseriine may make the largest contribution to interfacial effects in membranes involving non-specific electrostatic interactions. This normal distribution is disturbed during platelet activation and cellular apoptosis. In human plasma, 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl and 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl species predominate, but in brain (especially grey matter), retina and many other tissues 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl species are very abundant. Indeed, the ratio of n-3 to n-6 fatty acids in brain phosphatidylserine is very much higher than in most other lipids. While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. Phosphatidylserines typically carry a net charge of -1 at physiological pH. They mostly have palmitic or stearic acid on carbon 1 and a long chain unsaturated fatty acid (e.g. 18:2, 20:4 and 22:6) on carbon 2. PS biosynthesis involves an exchange reaction of serine for ethanolamine in PE.

The Erucyl alcohol moiety is derived from Rapeseed oil, while the (10Z,13Z,16Z-docosatrienoyl) moiety is derived from fish oils. Phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, as well as being involved in metabolism and signaling.

PCs can be synthesized via three different routes. In one route, choline is activated first by phosphorylation and then by coupling to CDP prior to attachment to phosphatidic acid. PCs can also synthesized by the addition of choline to CDP-activated 1,2-diacylglycerol. A third route to PC synthesis involves the conversion of either PS or PE to PC.

Phosphatidylinositols are important lipids, both as a key membrane constituent and as a participant in essential metabolic processes, both directly and via a number of metabolites. Phosphatidylinositols are acidic (anionic) phospholipids that consist of a phosphatidic acid backbone, linked via the phosphate group to inositol (hexahydroxycyclohexane). Phosphatidylinositols can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PI(16:0/22:5(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of palmitic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of docosapentaenoic acid at the C-2 position. The palmitic acid moiety is derived from fish oils, milk fats, vegetable oils and animal fats, while the docosapentaenoic acid moiety is derived from animal fats and brain. In most organisms, the stereochemical form of the last is myo-D-inositol (with one axial hydroxyl in position 2 with the remainder equatorial. Phosphatidylinositol is especially abundant in brain tissue, where it can amount to 10% of the phospholipids, but it is present in all tissues and cell types. There is usually less of it than of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine. In animal tissues, phosphatidylinositol is the primary source of the arachidonic acid required for biosynthesis of eicosanoids, including prostaglandins, via the action of the enzyme phospholipase A2. Phosphatidylinositol can be phosphorylated by a number of different kinases that place the phosphate moiety on positions 4 and 5 of the inositol ring, although position 3 can also be phosphorylated by a specific kinase. Seven different isomers are known, but the most important in both quantitative and biological terms are phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Phosphatidylinositol and the phosphatidylinositol phosphates are the main source of diacylglycerols that serve as signaling molecules, via the action of phospholipase C enzymes.While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PIs contain almost exclusively stearic acid at carbon 1 and arachidonic acid at carbon 2. PIs composed exclusively of non-phosphorylated inositol exhibit a net charge of -1 at physiological pH. Molecules with phosphorylated inositol (such as PIP, PIP2, PIP3, etc.) are termed polyphosphoinositides. The polyphosphoinositides are important intracellular transducers of signals emanating from the plasma membrane. The synthesis of PI involves CDP-activated 1,2-diacylglycerol condensation with myo-inositol.

This lipid is synthesized primarily in the oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. Accumulation of this lipid in the lysosomes is a characteristic of metachromatic leukodystrophy, a lysosomal storage disease caused by the deficiency of arylsulfatase A. Alterations in sulfatide metabolism, trafficking, and homeostasis are present in the earliest clinically recognizable stages of Alzheimer's disease. Cerebrosides are glycosphingolipids. There are four types of glycosphingolipids, the cerebrosides, sulfatides, globosides and gangliosides. Cerebrosides have a single sugar group linked to ceramide. The most common are galactocerebrosides (containing galactose), the least common are glucocerebrosides (containing glucose). Galactocerebrosides are found predominantly in neuronal cell membranes. In contrast glucocerebrosides are not normally found in membranes. Instead, they are typically intermediates in the synthesis or degradation of more complex glycosphingolipids. Galactocerebrosides are synthesized from ceramide and UDP-galactose. Excess lysosomal accumulation of glucocerebrosides is found in Gaucher disease. Sulfatides are glycosphingolipids. There are four types of glycosphingolipids, the cerebrosides, sulfatides, globosides and gangliosides. Sulfatides are the sulfuric acid esters of galactocerebrosides. They are synthesized from galactocerebrosides and activated sulfate, 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS).

It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphoglycerol moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site followed by another phosphate moiety. As is the case with diacylglycerols, phosphatidylglycerols can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PGP(16:0/22:4(7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of palmitic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of adrenic acid at the C-2 position. The palmitic acid moiety is derived from fish oils, milk fats, vegetable oils and animal fats, while the adrenic acid moiety is derived from animal fats. Phosphatidylglycerolphosphate is present at a level of 1-2% in most animal tissues, but it can be the second most abundant phospholipid in lung surfactant at up to 11% of the total. It is well established that the concentration of Phosphatidylglycerolphosphate increases during fetal development. Phosphatidylglycerolphosphate may be present in animal tissues merely as a precursor for diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin). Phosphatidylglycerol is formed from phosphatidic acid by a sequence of enzymatic reactions that proceeds via the intermediate, cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-diacylglycerol). Bioynthesis proceeds by condensation of phosphatidic acid and cytidine triphosphate with elimination of pyrophosphate via the action of phosphatidate cytidyltransferase (or CDP-synthase). CDP-diacylglycerol then reacts with glycerol-3-phosphate via phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase to form 3-sn-phosphatidyl-1'-sn-glycerol 3'-phosphoric acid, with the release of cytidine monophosphate (CMP). Finally, phosphatidylglycerol is formed by the action of specific phosphatases. While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PGPs have a net charge of -1 at physiological pH and are found in high concentration in mitochondrial membranes and as components of pulmonary surfactant. PGP also serves as a precursor for the synthesis of cardiolipin. PGP is synthesized from CDP-diacylglycerol and glycerol-3-phosphate.

It is a vital component of cellular membranes of most eukaryotic organisms and some bacteria. Its abundance relative to other lipids is usually low other than in epithelial and neuronal cells. Galabiosylceramide is one of the lipids that accumulate in excessive amounts in Fabry's disease. Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked inborn error of glycosphingolipid (GSL) metabolism, caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal alpha-galactosidase A, which results in high levels in lysosomes and biological fluids of galabiosylceramide, also known as digalactosylceramide (Ga2). In Fabry disease, accumulation of galabiosylceramide is observed by coloration methods associated to optic or electron microscopy or more recently, with imaging mass spectrometry. Galabiosylceramide is the precursor of a series of oligoglycosylceramides. In animal tissues, biosynthesis involves addition of a second monosaccharide unit from the appropriate sugar nucleotide to a monoglycosylceramide, catalysed by a glycosyl transferase, in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus. Glycolipids are important components of the body's immune defense system, either in haptenic reactivity or in antibody-producing potency, i.e. as cellular immunogens or antigens.

It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylcholine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. As is the case with diacylglycerols, glycerophosphocholines can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PC(20:3(5Z,8Z,11Z)/24:1(15Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of mead acid at the C-1 position and one chain of nervonic acid at the C-2 position. The mead acid moiety is derived from fish oils, liver and kidney, while the nervonic acid moiety is derived from fish oils. Phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, as well as being involved in metabolism and signaling.While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PCs can be synthesized via three different routes. In one route, choline is activated first by phosphorylation and then by coupling to CDP prior to attachment to phosphatidic acid. PCs can also synthesized by the addition of choline to CDP-activated 1,2-diacylglycerol. A third route to PC synthesis involves the conversion of either PS or PE to PC.

This lipid occurs in membranes of various cell types, but is found in particularly high concentrations in myelin where it constitutes 3-4% of total membrane lipids. This lipid is synthesized primarily in the oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. Accumulation of this lipid in the lysosomes is a characteristic of metachromatic leukodystrophy, a lysosomal storage disease caused by the deficiency of arylsulfatase A. Alterations in sulfatide metabolism, trafficking, and homeostasis are present in the earliest clinically recognizable stages of Alzheimer's disease.Cerebrosides are glycosphingolipids. There are four types of glycosphingolipids, the cerebrosides, sulfatides, globosides and gangliosides. Cerebrosides have a single sugar group linked to ceramide. The most common are galactocerebrosides (containing galactose), the least common are glucocerebrosides (containing glucose). Galactocerebrosides are found predominantly in neuronal cell membranes. In contrast glucocerebrosides are not normally found in membranes. Instead, they are typically intermediates in the synthesis or degradation of more complex glycosphingolipids. Galactocerebrosides are synthesized from ceramide and UDP-galactose. Excess lysosomal accumulation of glucocerebrosides is found in Gaucher disease. Sulfatides are glycosphingolipids. There are four types of glycosphingolipids, the cerebrosides, sulfatides, globosides and gangliosides. Sulfatides are the sulfuric acid esters of galactocerebrosides. They are synthesized from galactocerebrosides and activated sulfate, 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS).

Dinucleoside polyphosphates are an interesting group of signalling molecules that control numerous physiological functions. Diadenosine compounds, with a backbone of anything from two to seven phosphates, are known to occur naturally. Some of them have been isolated from cerebral nerve terminals and, acting via nucleoside (P1), nucleotide (P2), or dinucleotide receptors, can affect central nervous system function. Many of them have been isolated from human blood platelet secretory granules and are potentially involved in haemostatic mechanisms and peripheral control of vascular tone. Many visceral organs respond to the application of adenine dinucleotides and, although they act on receptors in the periphery that can be mainly defined as either P1 or P2, evidence is now accumulating for discrete dinucleotide receptors. In the periphery, adenine dinucleotides can be potent agonists, with diverse functions, causing contraction or relaxation of smooth muscle. Many P2X receptor proteins and P2Y receptors have been cloned and adenine dinucleotides have a variable pharmacological profile at these receptors and may be useful tools for characterising subtypes of P2X and P2Y receptors. Many extracellular roles of diadenosine polyphosphates are emerging as yet increasingly important, natural ligands for a plethora of structurally diverse mononucleotide and dinucleotide receptors.

Also known as alpha-hypophamine (&#945;-hypophamine), oxytocin has the distinction of being the very first polypeptide hormone to be sequenced and synthesized biochemically by Vincent du Vigneaud et al. in 1953. Oxytocin is best known for its roles in female reproduction: 1) it is released in large amounts after distension of the cervix and vagina during labor, and 2) after stimulation of the nipples, facilitating birth and breastfeeding, respectively. Recent studies have begun to investigate oxytocin's role in various behaviors, including orgasm, social recognition, pair bonding, anxiety, trust, love, and maternal behaviors.

Triglycerides (TGs) are also known as triacylglycerols or triacylglycerides, meaning that they are glycerides in which the glycerol is esterified with three fatty acid groups (i.e. fatty acid tri-esters of glycerol). TGs may be divided into three general types with respect to their acyl substituents. They are simple or monoacid if they contain only one type of fatty acid, diacid if they contain two types of fatty acids and triacid if three different acyl groups. Chain lengths of the fatty acids in naturally occurring triglycerides can be of varying lengths and saturations but 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. TG(20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)/18:2(9Z,12Z)/22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z))[iso6], in particular, consists of one chain of arachidonic acid at the C-1 position, one chain of linoleic acid at the C-2 position and one chain of docosahexaenoic acid at the C-3 position. TGs are the main constituent of vegetable oil and animal fats. TGs are major components of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicrons, play an important role in metabolism as energy sources and transporters of dietary fat. They contain more than twice the energy (9 kcal/g) of carbohydrates and proteins. In the intestine, triglycerides are split into glycerol and fatty acids (this process is called lipolysis) with the help of lipases and bile secretions, which can then move into blood vessels. The triglycerides are rebuilt in the blood from their fragments and become constituents of lipoproteins, which deliver the fatty acids to and from fat cells among other functions. Various tissues can release the free fatty acids and take them up as a source of energy. Fat cells can synthesize and store triglycerides. When the body requires fatty acids as an energy source, the hormone glucagon signals the breakdown of the triglycerides by hormone-sensitive lipase to release free fatty acids. As the brain cannot utilize fatty acids as an energy source, the glycerol component of triglycerides can be converted into glucose for brain fuel when it is broken down. (www.cyberlipid.org, www.wikipedia.org)TAGs can serve as fatty acid stores in all cells, but primarily in adipocytes of adipose tissue. The major building block for the synthesis of triacylglycerides, in non-adipose tissue, is glycerol. Adipocytes lack glycerol kinase and so must use another route to TAG synthesis. Specifically, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), which is produced during glycolysis, is the precursor for TAG synthesis in adipose tissue. DHAP can also serve as a TAG precursor in non-adipose tissues, but does so to a much lesser extent than glycerol. The use of DHAP for the TAG backbone depends on whether the synthesis of the TAGs occurs in the mitochondria and ER or the ER and the peroxisomes. The ER/mitochondria pathway requires the action of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to convert DHAP to glycerol-3-phosphate. Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase then esterifies a fatty acid to glycerol-3-phosphate thereby generating lysophosphatidic acid. The ER/peroxisome reaction pathway uses the peroxisomal enzyme DHAP acyltransferase to acylate DHAP to acyl-DHAP which is then reduced by acyl-DHAP reductase. The fatty acids that are incorporated into TAGs are activated to acyl-CoAs through the action of acyl-CoA synthetases. Two molecules of acyl-CoA are esterified to glycerol-3-phosphate to yield 1,2-diacylglycerol phosphate (also known as phosphatidic acid). The phosphate is then removed by phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP1), to generate 1,2-diacylglycerol. This diacylglycerol serves as the substrate for addition of the third fatty acid to make TAG. Intestinal monoacylglycerols, derived from dietary fats, can also serve as substrates for the synthesis of 1,2-diacylglycerols.

The major building block for the synthesis of triacylglycerides, in non-adipose tissue, is glycerol. Adipocytes lack glycerol kinase and so must use another route to TAG synthesis. Specifically, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), which is produced during glycolysis, is the precursor for TAG synthesis in adipose tissue. DHAP can also serve as a TAG precursor in non-adipose tissues, but does so to a much lesser extent than glycerol. The use of DHAP for the TAG backbone depends on whether the synthesis of the TAGs occurs in the mitochondria and ER or the ER and the peroxisomes. The ER/mitochondria pathway requires the action of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to convert DHAP to glycerol-3-phosphate. Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase then esterifies a fatty acid to glycerol-3-phosphate thereby generating lysophosphatidic acid. The ER/peroxisome reaction pathway uses the peroxisomal enzyme DHAP acyltransferase to acylate DHAP to acyl-DHAP which is then reduced by acyl-DHAP reductase. The fatty acids that are incorporated into TAGs are activated to acyl-CoAs through the action of acyl-CoA synthetases. Two molecules of acyl-CoA are esterified to glycerol-3-phosphate to yield 1,2-diacylglycerol phosphate (also known as phosphatidic acid). The phosphate is then removed by phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP1), to generate 1,2-diacylglycerol. This diacylglycerol serves as the substrate for addition of the third fatty acid to make TAG. Intestinal monoacylglycerols, derived from dietary fats, can also serve as substrates for the synthesis of 1,2-diacylglycerols.

PIP2(16:0/16:1(9Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of palmitic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of palmitoleic acid at the C-2 position. The palmitic acid moiety is derived from fish oils, milk fats, vegetable oils and animal fats, while the palmitoleic acid moiety is derived from animal fats and vegetable oils. The most important phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate in both quantitative and biological terms is phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Phosphatidylinositol and the phosphatidylinositol phosphates are the main source of diacylglycerols that serve as signaling molecules, via the action of phospholipase C enzymes. Phosphatidylinositols phosphates are usually present at low levels only in tissues, typically at about 1 to 3% of the concentration of phosphatidylinositol.

Triglycerides (TGs) are also known as triacylglycerols or triacylglycerides, meaning that they are glycerides in which the glycerol is esterified with three fatty acid groups (i.e. fatty acid tri-esters of glycerol). TGs may be divided into three general types with respect to their acyl substituents. They are simple or monoacid if they contain only one type of fatty acid, diacid if they contain two types of fatty acids and triacid if three different acyl groups. Chain lengths of the fatty acids in naturally occurring triglycerides can be of varying lengths and saturations but 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. TG(20:0/20:0/20:1(11Z))[iso3], in particular, consists of one chain of arachidic acid at the C-1 position, one chain of arachidic acid at the C-2 position and one chain of eicosenoic acid at the C-3 position. TGs are the main constituent of vegetable oil and animal fats. TGs are major components of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicrons, play an important role in metabolism as energy sources and transporters of dietary fat. They contain more than twice the energy (9 kcal/g) of carbohydrates and proteins. In the intestine, triglycerides are split into glycerol and fatty acids (this process is called lipolysis) with the help of lipases and bile secretions, which can then move into blood vessels. The triglycerides are rebuilt in the blood from their fragments and become constituents of lipoproteins, which deliver the fatty acids to and from fat cells among other functions. Various tissues can release the free fatty acids and take them up as a source of energy. Fat cells can synthesize and store triglycerides. When the body requires fatty acids as an energy source, the hormone glucagon signals the breakdown of the triglycerides by hormone-sensitive lipase to release free fatty acids. As the brain cannot utilize fatty acids as an energy source, the glycerol component of triglycerides can be converted into glucose for brain fuel when it is broken down. (www.cyberlipid.org, www.wikipedia.org)TAGs can serve as fatty acid stores in all cells, but primarily in adipocytes of adipose tissue. The major building block for the synthesis of triacylglycerides, in non-adipose tissue, is glycerol. Adipocytes lack glycerol kinase and so must use another route to TAG synthesis. Specifically, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), which is produced during glycolysis, is the precursor for TAG synthesis in adipose tissue. DHAP can also serve as a TAG precursor in non-adipose tissues, but does so to a much lesser extent than glycerol. The use of DHAP for the TAG backbone depends on whether the synthesis of the TAGs occurs in the mitochondria and ER or the ER and the peroxisomes. The ER/mitochondria pathway requires the action of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to convert DHAP to glycerol-3-phosphate. Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase then esterifies a fatty acid to glycerol-3-phosphate thereby generating lysophosphatidic acid. The ER/peroxisome reaction pathway uses the peroxisomal enzyme DHAP acyltransferase to acylate DHAP to acyl-DHAP which is then reduced by acyl-DHAP reductase. The fatty acids that are incorporated into TAGs are activated to acyl-CoAs through the action of acyl-CoA synthetases. Two molecules of acyl-CoA are esterified to glycerol-3-phosphate to yield 1,2-diacylglycerol phosphate (also known as phosphatidic acid). The phosphate is then removed by phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP1), to generate 1,2-diacylglycerol. This diacylglycerol serves as the substrate for addition of the third fatty acid to make TAG. Intestinal monoacylglycerols, derived from dietary fats, can also serve as substrates for the synthesis of 1,2-diacylglycerols.

994.9830245_MZ	Diadenosine hexaphosphate	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Diadenosine hexaphosphate (AP6A) is a diadenosine polyphosphate. Diadenosine polyphosphates (APnAs, n = 3-6) are a family of endogenous vasoactive purine dinucleotides which have been isolated from thrombocytes. APnAs have been demonstrated to be involved in the control of vascular tone as well as the growth of vascular smooth muscle cells and hence, possibly, in atherogenesis. APnAs isolated substances are AP3A, AP4A, AP5A, and AP6A. APnAs are naturally occurring substances that facilitate tear secretion; they are released from the corneal epithelium, they stimulate tear production and therefore they may be considered as physiological modulators of tear secretion. The APnAs were discovered in the mid-sixties in the course of studies on aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS). APnAs have emerged as intracellular and extracellular signalling molecules implicated in the maintenance and regulation of vital cellular functions and become considered as second messengers. Great variety of physiological and pathological effects in mammalian cells was found to be associated with alterations of APnAs. APnAs are polyphosphated nucleotidic substances which are found in the CNS and are known to be released in a calcium-dependent manner from storage vesicles in brain synaptosomes. AP6A is an avid inhibitor of eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN). EDN is a catalytically proficient member of the pancreatic ribonuclease superfamily secreted along with other eosinophil granule proteins during innate host defense responses and various eosinophil-related inflammatory and allergic diseases. The ribonucleolytic activity of EDN is central to its antiviral and neurotoxic activities and possibly to other facets of its biological activity. AP6A have been demonstrated to be involved in the control of vascular tone as well as the growth of vascular smooth muscle cells and hence, possibly, in atherogenesis. AP6A have been identified in human platelets and shown to be an important modulator of cardiovascular function. (PMID: 11212966, 12738682, 11810214, 9607303, 8922753, 16401072, 12738682, 10094777).

995.3627300_MZ	Crocin	Un	1.0	None	None	None	None	Crocin is a water-soluble carotenoid pigment of saffron (Crocus sativus L.) that has been used as a spice for flavoring and coloring food preparations, and in Chinese traditional medicine as an anodyne or tranquilizer. Saffron is now used worldwide in folk medicine and is reputed to be useful in treating various human disorders such as heart and blood disorders. Stroke and heart attack are involved in reputed folkloric uses of saffron. Saffron is orally administrated as a decoction. Saffron extract exerts a protective effect on renal ischemia reperfusion induced oxidative damage in rats. Crocin suppresses tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha-induced apoptosis of pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells by modulating mRNA expressions of Bcl-2 family proteins, which trigger downstream signals culminating in caspase-3 activation followed by cell death. Depriving cultured PC12 cells of serum/glucose causes a rapid increase in cellular ceramide levels, followed by an increase in the risk of cell death. The accumulation of ceramide was found to depend on the activation of neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase). Crocin prevented the activation of nSMase by enhancing the transcription of gamma-glutamylcysteinyl synthase, which contributes to a stable glutathione supply that blocks the activity of nSMase. (PMID: 17215084). Crocetin esters present in saffron stigmas and in Gardenia jasminoides Ellis fruit are the compounds responsible for their color. (PMID: 16448211).
